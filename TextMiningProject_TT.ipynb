[3] He held the top ATP ranking for a then-record 160 consecutive weeks from 1974 to 1977 and a career total of 268 weeks. By virtue of his long and prolific career, Connors still holds three prominent Open Era men\\'s singles records : 109 titles, 1,556 matches played, and 1,274 match wins. His titles include eight majors (joint Open Era five US Open titles, two Wimbledon titles, one Australian Open title), three year-end championships , and 17 Grand Prix Super Series titles. In 1974, he became the second man in the Open Era to win three majors in a calendar year (and was not permitted to participate in the fourth, the French Open).  In 1982, he won both Wimbledon and the US Open and is considered to be the World-number-one Player for that year, in addition to 1974 and 1976. He retired in 1996 at the age of 43.

During his childhood he was coached and trained by his mother and grandmother. [4] He played in his first U.S. Championship, the U.S. boys\\' 11-and-under of 1961, when he was nine years old. Connors\\' mother, Gloria, took him to Southern California to be coached by Pancho Segura , starting at age 16, in 1968. [5] He and his brother, John \"Johnny\" Connors, attended St. Phillip\\'s grade school. Connors won the Junior Orange Bowl in both the 12- and the 14-year categories, and is one of only nine tennis players to win the Junior Orange Bowl championship twice in its 70-year history, which list includes Andy Murray , Jennifer Capriati , Monica Seles , and Yshai Oliel . [6] In 1970, Connors recorded his first victory in the first round of the Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles, defeating Roy Emerson . In 1971, Connors won the NCAA singles title as a Freshman while attending UCLA and attained All-American status. He turned professional in 1972 and won his first tournament, the Jacksonville Open . Connors was acquiring a reputation as a maverick in 1972 when he refused to join the newly formed Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), the union that was embraced by most male professional players, in order to play in and dominate a series of smaller tournaments organized by Bill Riordan, his manager. However, Connors played in other tournaments and won the 1973 U.S. Pro Singles, his first significant title, toppling Arthur Ashe in a five-set final, 6–3, 4–6, 6–4, 3–6, 6–2.  Peak years [ edit ]   Connors at the 1978 ABN Tennis Tournament holding his Wilson T2000 steel racket  Connors won eight Grand Slam singles championships: five US Opens , two Wimbledons , and one Australian Open . He did not participate in the French Open during his peak years (1974–78), as he was banned from playing by the event in 1974 due to his association with World Team Tennis (WTT). [7] [8] and in the other four years was either banned or chose not to participate. He only played in two Australian Opens in his entire career, winning it in 1974 and reaching the final in 1975. Few highly ranked players, aside from Australians, travelled to Australia for that event up until the mid-1980s. In 1974, Connors was the dominant player and held the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year. He had a 99–4 record that year and won 15 tournaments of the 21 he entered, including three of the four Grand Slam singles titles. As noted, the French Open did not allow Connors to participate due to his association with World Team Tennis (WTT), but he won the Australian Open , which began in late December 1973 and concluded on January 1, 1974 , defeating Phil Dent in four sets, and beat Ken Rosewall in straight sets in the finals of both Wimbledon and the US Open losing only 6 and 2 games, respectively, in those finals. His exclusion from the French Open denied him the opportunity to become the second male player of the Open Era, after Rod Laver , to win all four Major singles titles in a calendar year.  He chose not to participate in the season-ending Masters Cup between the top eight players of the world and was not eligible for the World Championship Tennis (WCT) finals because he did not compete in the WCT\\'s regular tournaments. In the open era, Connors is one of only six men to win three or more Grand Slam singles titles in a calendar year. The others are: Rod Laver who won the Grand Slam in 1969; Mats Wilander won the Australian, French and US Open in 1988; Roger Federer won the Australian, Wimbledon and US Open in 2004, 2006 and 2007; Rafael Nadal won the French, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2010; and Novak Djokovic won the Australian, Wimbledon, and US Open in 2011 and 2015. Connors reached the final of the US Open in five straight years from 1974 through 1978, winning three times with each win being on a different surface ( 1974 on grass, 1976 on clay and 1978 on hard). He reached the final of Wimbledon four out of five years during his peak ( 1974 , 1975 , 1977 and 1978 ). Despite not being allowed to play or choosing not to participate in the French Open from 1974 to 1978, he was still able to reach the semifinals four times in the later years of his career. In 1975, Connors reached the finals of Wimbledon, the US Open and Australia, he but did not win any of them, although his loss to John Newcombe was close as Connors lost 9-7 in a fourth set tiebreak. He won nine of the tournaments he entered achieving an 82–8 record.  While he achieved enough points to retain the ATP No. 1 ranking the entire year, most tennis authorities, including the ATP, named Arthur Ashe, who solidly defeated Connors at Wimbledon, as the Player of the Year. He once again did not participate in the Masters Cup or the WCT Finals. In 1976 , Connors captured the US Open once again (defeating Björn Borg) while losing in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon. While winning 12 events, including the U.S. Pro Indoor in Philadelphia, Palm Springs and Las Vegas, he achieved a record of 90–8 and defeated Borg all four times they played. He was ranked No. 1 by the ATP for the entire year and was named the player of the year by most tennis sources, but not by the ATP, which named Björn Borg as its player of the year. In 1977, Connors lost in the Wimbledon finals to Borg 6-4 in the fifth set and in the US Open finals to Guillermo Vilas, but Connors captured both the Masters, beating Borg, and the WCT Finals. While holding onto the ATP No. 1 ranking, the ATP and most tennis authorities ranked Borg or Vilas No. 1 with Connors rated as No. 3. In 1978, Borg defeated Connors in the Wimbledon final, but Connors defeated Borg at the US Open (played on hard court for the inaugural time) with both of their victories being dominating.  Connors also won the U.S. Pro Indoor. While he retained the ATP No. 1 ranking at the end of the year, the ATP and most tennis authorities rated Borg, who also won the French Open, as the player of the year. Connors reached the ATP world No. 1 ranking on July 29, 1974 and held it for 160 consecutive weeks, a record until it was surpassed by Roger Federer on February 26, 2007. He was the ATP year-end no. 1 player from 1974 through 1978 and held the No. 1 ranking for a total of 268 weeks during his career. In 1979 through 1981, Connors generally reached the semi-finals of the three top Grand Slam events and the Masters each year, but he did win the WCT Finals in 1980. He was generally ranked third in the world those years. In 1982 Connors experienced a resurgence as he defeated John McEnroe in five close sets to win Wimbledon and Ivan Lendl to win the US Open after which he reclaimed the ATP No. 1 ranking. He also reached the semi-final of the Masters Cup and won five other tournaments.  After trading the No. 1 ranking with back and forth with McEnroe, he finished the year ranked No. 2 in points earned, but he was named Player of the Year by the ATP and most other authorities due to his victories at Wimbledon and the US Open. In 1983, Connors, McEnroe and Lendl traded the No. 1 ranking several times with Connors winning the US Open for a record fifth time and finishing the year as the No. 3 ranked player.  Contemporaries and rivalries [ edit ]  Prominent contemporary players with Connors included Phil Dent , Brian Gottfried , Raul Ramírez , Harold Solomon , Dick Stockton , Roscoe Tanner , and Guillermo Vilas . His older rivals included Arthur Ashe , Rod Laver , Ilie Năstase , John Newcombe , Manuel Orantes , Ken Rosewall , and Stan Smith . His prominent younger opponents included Björn Borg , Vitas Gerulaitis , Ivan Lendl , and John McEnroe .  Björn Borg [ edit ]  Main article: Borg–Connors rivalry  During his best years of 1974 through 1978, Connors was challenged the most by Borg, with twelve matches on tour during that time frame. Borg won only four of those meetings, but two of those wins were in the Wimbledon finals of 1977 and 1978 . Connors lost his stranglehold on the top ranking to Borg in early 1979 and wound up with an official tour record of 8–15 against Borg as Borg is four years younger and won the last ten times they met. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their four meetings, Borg winning two Wimbledons ( 1977 & 1978 ) and Connors winning two US Opens ( 1976 & 1978 ).  Ilie Năstase [ edit ]  Nastase was another rival in Connors\\' prime. Though six years older than Connors, Nastase won ten of their first eleven meetings. However, Connors won 11 of their final 14 meetings. The two would team up to win the doubles championships at the 1973 Wimbledon and the 1975 US Open.  Manuel Orantes and Guillermo Vilas [ edit ]  Orantes upset Connors in the final of the 1975 US Open , but Connors was 11–3 overall against Orantes in tour events. On the other hand, Vilas wore down Connors in the final of the 1977 US Open and was much more competitive in all of their meetings. Connors was only able to manage a 5–4 record against Vilas in tour events.  Rod Laver and John Newcombe [ edit ]  In 1975, Connors won two highly touted \"Challenge Matches\", both arranged by the Riordan company and televised nationally by CBS Sports from Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada . The first match, in February and billed as $100,000 ($465,615 today) winner-takes-all, was against Laver. Connors won that match, 6–4, 6–2, 3–6, 7–5. In April, Connors met Newcombe in a match billed as a $250,000 winner-takes-all. Connors won the match, 6–3, 4–6, 6–2, 6–4. Connors ended his business relationship with Riordan later in 1975. [4]  Connors played Newcombe in four tour events, with Newcombe winning the first two meetings on grass (1973 US Open quarterfinal and 1975 Australian Open final) and Connors winning the last two on hard courts (1978 Sydney Indoor quarterfinal and 1979 Hong Kong round of 16). Connors won all three meetings with Rod Laver in tour events.  Later years [ edit ]  In 1984 Connors had made both the finals of Wimbledon and the WCT finals with semifinal appearances at the French Open, the US Open, and the Masters Cup.  He finished the year as the No. 2 ranked player after McEnroe. In 1985 he made the semi-finals of the big 4 four events and finished number No. 4 for the year, a ranking he would again obtain in 1987 at the age of 35. Connors had shining moments against John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl , both of whom rose to prominence after Connors peaked in the mid-1970s. He would continue to compete against much younger players and had one of the most remarkable comebacks for any athlete when he reached the semifinals of the 1991 US Open at the age of 39.  John McEnroe [ edit ]  Main article: Connors–McEnroe rivalry  In the 1980 WCT Finals , Connors defeated the defending champion, John McEnroe. McEnroe and Borg were battling for the top spot in that year, while Connors played the role of the spoiler. However, in 1982, at age 29, Connors was back in the Wimbledon singles final, where he faced McEnroe, who by then was established firmly as the world\\'s top player. Connors recovered from being three points away from defeat in a fourth-set tie-break (at 3–4) to win the match, 3–6, 6–3, 6–7, 7–6, 6–4, and claimed his second Wimbledon title, eight years after his first. Although Connors\\' tour record against McEnroe was 14–20, McEnroe is six years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won 12 out of their last 14 meetings. Head to head in major championship finals, they split their two meetings, Connors winning the 1982 Wimbledon in five sets, and McEnroe winning the 1984 Wimbledon in straight sets.  Ivan Lendl [ edit ]  Main article: Connors–Lendl rivalry  Connors defeated another of the next generation of tennis stars, Ivan Lendl, in the 1982 US Open final and soon regained the No. 1 ranking. Connors had a tour record of 13–22 against Lendl, but Lendl is seven years younger than Connors and had a losing record against Connors until he won their last 17 matches from 1984 through 1992, after Connors\\' prime. Head to head in major championship finals, Connors defeated Lendl in both meetings, winning the 1982 and 1983 US Open.  Other matches [ edit ]  Connors continued to compete against younger men well into his 41st year. In the fourth round of the 1987 Wimbledon Championships , Connors defeated Mikael Pernfors , ten years his junior, 1–6, 1–6, 7–5, 6–4, 6–2, after having trailed 4–1 in the third set and 3–0 in the fourth set. In July 1988, Connors ended a four-year title drought by winning the Sovran Bank Tennis Classic in Washington, D.C. It was the 106th title of his career. Connors had played in 56 tournaments and lost 11 finals since his previous victory in the Tokyo Indoors against Lendl in October 1984. At the 1989 US Open, Connors defeated the third seed (and future two-time champion), Stefan Edberg , in straight sets in the fourth round and pushed sixth-seeded Andre Agassi to five sets in a quarterfinal. His career seemed to be at an end in 1990, when he played only three tournament matches and lost all three, dropping to No. 936 in the world rankings. However, after surgery on his deteriorating left wrist, he came back to play 14 tournaments in 1991. An ailing back forced him to retire from a five-sets match in the third round of the French Open against Michael Chang , the 1989 champion. Connors walked off the court after hitting a winner against Chang. Connors recuperated and made an improbable run to the 1991 US Open semifinals which he later said were \"the best 11 days of my tennis career\". [9] On his 39th birthday he defeated 24-year-old Aaron Krickstein , 3–6, 7–6, 1–6, 6–3, 7–6, in 4 hours and 41 minutes, coming back from a 2–5 deficit in the final set. Connors then defeated Paul Haarhuis in the quarterfinals before losing to Jim Courier . 22 years later ESPN aired a documentary commemorating Connors\\' run. [10]  Connors participated in his last major tournament, in the 1992 US Open, where he beat Jaime Oncins , 6–1, 6–2, 6–3 in the first round, before losing to Lendl (then ranked No. 7), 6–3, 3–6, 2–6, 0–6 in the second round. In September 1992, Connors played Martina Navratilova in the third Battle of the Sexes tennis match at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada . Connors was allowed only one serve per point and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won, 7–5, 6–2. However, this would not be the end of his playing career. As late as June 1995, three months shy of his 43rd birthday Connors beat Sébastien Lareau , 6–4, 7–6, and Martin Sinner , 7–6, 6–0, to progress to the quarterfinals of the Halle event in Germany. Connors lost this quarterfinal, 6–7, 3–6 to Marc Rosset . Connors\\' last match on the main ATP tour came in April 1996, when he lost, 2–6, 6–3, 1–6, to Richey Reneberg in Atlanta. [11]   Maverick [ edit ]  In 1974, Connors and Riordan began filing lawsuits, amounting to $10 million, against the ATP and its president, Arthur Ashe , for allegedly restricting his freedom in the game. The lawsuits stemmed from the French Open banning Connors in 1974 after he had signed a contract to play World Team Tennis (WTT) for the Baltimore Banners . Connors was seeking to enter the French Open, but the ATP and French officials opposed WTT because of scheduling conflicts, so the entries of WTT players were refused between 1974 and 1978. Connors dropped Riordan and eventually the lawsuits after losing to Ashe in the 1975 Wimbledon final (according to the official film produced by Wimbledon 1975, his $2 million suit against Ashe was still outstanding when the two met in the 1975 Wimbledon final). At Wimbledon in 1977, he declined to participate in a parade of former champions to celebrate the tournament\\'s centenary, choosing instead to practice in the grounds with Ilie Nastase while the parade took place. In 2000, he also declined to join a gathering of 58 former champions held to mark the millennium. In his 2013 autobiography, Connors blamed his missing the 1977 parade on the All England Club for not letting his doctor onto the grounds so that Connors could try on a customized splint for a thumb injury. Connors explained that this necessitated his rushing to meet the doctor at the entrance to the grounds, and then convincing Nastase to help him try out the splint on a practice court. By Connors\\' account, he then rushed to Centre Court for the parade, but was too late. He was booed when he played his first round match the next day. Reaching the final, he lost in five sets to Borg, who a month later was able briefly to interrupt Connors\\'s long hold on the world No. 1 ranking. Connors also irritated sponsors and tennis officials by shunning the end-of-year Masters championship from 1974 through 1976. However, he entered this round-robin competition in 1977 when it moved to New York City. Although Connors lost a celebrated late-night match to Vilas, 4–6, 6–3, 5–7, he took the title by defeating Borg in the final, 6–4, 1–6, 6–4.  Distinctions and honors [ edit ]  Connors won a male record 109 singles titles. [12] He also won 16 doubles titles (including the men\\'s doubles titles at Wimbledon in 1973 and the US Open in 1975). Connors has won more matches (1,274) than any other male professional tennis player in the open era. His career win-loss record was 1,274–282 for a winning percentage of 82.4. [13] He played 401 tournaments, a record until Fabrice Santoro overtook it in 2008. [14]  In Grand Slam Singles events, Connors reached the semifinals or better a total of 31 times and the quarterfinals or better a total of 41 times, despite entering the Australian Open Men\\'s Singles only twice and not entering the French Open Men\\'s Singles for five of his peak career years. The 31 semifinals stood as a record until surpassed by Roger Federer at Wimbledon 2012. The 41 quarterfinals remained a record until Roger Federer surpassed it at Wimbledon 2014. Connors was the only player to win the US Open on three different surfaces: grass , clay , and hard . He was also the first male tennis player to win Grand Slam singles titles on three different surfaces: grass (1974), clay (1976), and hard (1978). Connors was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1998 and Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Hall of Fame in 1986. He also has a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame . [15] In his 1979 autobiography, tennis promoter and Grand Slam winning player Jack Kramer ranked Connors as one of the 21 best players of all time. Because of his fiery competitiveness and acrimonious relationships with a number of peers, he has been likened to baseball player Pete Rose . [10]   Playing style [ edit ]  Jimmy Connors (1978) Jimmy Connors (2007)  In the modern era of power tennis, Connors\\'s style of play has often been cited as highly influential, especially in the development of the flat backhand. Larry Schwartz on ESPN.com said about Connors, \"His biggest weapons were an indomitable spirit, a two-handed backhand and the best service return in the game. It is difficult to say which was more instrumental in Connors becoming a champion.\\xa0... Though smaller than most of his competitors, Connors didn\\'t let it bother him, making up for a lack of size with determination.\" [16] Of his own competitive nature Connors has said, \"[T]here\\'s always somebody out there who\\'s willing to push it that extra inch, or mile, and that was me. (Laughter) I didn\\'t care if it took me 30 minutes or five hours. If you beat me, you had to be the best, or the best you had that day. But that was my passion for the game. If I won, I won, and if I lost, well, I didn\\'t take it so well.\" [2]  His on-court antics, designed to get the crowd involved, both helped and hurt his play. Schwartz said, \"While tennis fans enjoyed Connors\\'s gritty style and his never-say-die attitude, they often were shocked by his antics. His sometimes vulgar on-court behavior—like giving the finger to a linesman after disagreeing with a call or strutting about the court with the tennis racket handle between his legs; sometimes he would yank on the handle in a grotesque manner and his fans would go wild or groan in disapproval—did not help his approval rating. During the early part of his career, Connors frequently argued with umpires, linesmen, the players union, Davis Cup officials and other players. He was even booed at Wimbledon —a rare show of disapproval there—for snubbing the Parade of Champions on the first day of the Centenary in 1977.\" [16] His brash behavior both on and off the court earned him a reputation as the brat of the tennis world. Tennis commentator Bud Collins nicknamed Connors the \"Brash Basher of Belleville\" after the St Louis suburb where he grew up. [17] Connors himself thrived on the energy of the crowd, positive or negative, and manipulated and exploited it to his advantage in many of the greatest matches of his career. [ citation needed ]  Connors was taught to hit the ball on the rise by his teaching-pro mother, Gloria Connors, a technique he used to defeat the opposition in the early years of his career. Gloria sent her son to Southern California to work with Pancho Segura at the age of 16. Segura advanced Connors\\' game of hitting the ball on the rise which enabled Connors to reflect the power and velocity of his opponents back at them. Segura was the master strategist in developing Jimmy\\'s complete game. In the 1975 Wimbledon final, Arthur Ashe countered this strategy by taking the pace off the ball, giving Connors only soft junk shots (dinks, drop shots, and lobs) to hit. In an era when the serve and volley was the norm, Björn Borg excepted, Connors was one of the few players to hit the ball flat, low, and predominantly from the baseline. Connors hit his forehand with a semi-Western grip and with little net clearance. [18] Contemporaries such as Arthur Ashe and commentators such as Joel Drucker characterized his forehand as his greatest weakness, especially on extreme pressure points, as it lacked the safety margin of hard forehands hit with topspin. His serve, while accurate and capable, was never a great weapon for him as it did not reach the velocity and power of his opponents. His lack of a dominating serve and net game, combined with his individualist style and maverick tendencies, meant that he was not as successful in doubles as he was in singles, although he did win Grand Slam titles with Ilie Năstase , reached a final with Chris Evert , and accumulated 16 doubles titles during his career.  Racket evolution [ edit ]  At a time when most other tennis pros played with wooden rackets, Connors used the \"Wilson T2000\" steel racket, which utilized a method for stringing that had been devised and patented by Lacoste in 1953. [19] [20] He played with this chrome tubular steel racket until 1984, when most other pros had shifted to new racket technologies, materials, and designs. [20]  At the Tokyo Indoor in October 1983, Connors switched to a new mid-size graphite racket, the Wilson ProStaff, that had been designed especially for him and he used it on the 1984 tour. [21] But 1985 again found Connors playing with the T2000. In 1987, he finally switched to a graphite racket when he signed a contract with Slazenger to play their Panther Pro Ceramic. In 1990, Connors signed with Estusa. [20]  Connors used lead tape which he would wind around the racket head to provide the proper \"feel\" for his style of game.  Commentating [ edit ]  Connors did commentary with NBC-TV in 1990 and 1991, during its coverage of the French Open and Wimbledon tournaments. During the Wimbledon tournaments of 2005, 2006, and 2007, Connors commentated for the BBC alongside John McEnroe (among others), providing moments of heated discussion between two former archrivals. Connors returned to BBC commentary at Wimbledon in 2014. Connors has also served as a commentator and analyst for the Tennis Channel since the US Open tournament of 2009. [22]   Coaching [ edit ]  On July 24, 2006, at the start of the Countrywide Classic tournament in Los Angeles, American tennis player Andy Roddick announced his partnership with Connors as his coach. In September, 2006 Roddick reached the final of the U.S. Open, where he lost to Roger Federer . On March 6, 2008, Roddick announced the end of that 19-month relationship. In July 2013 former women\\'s world No. 1 Maria Sharapova announced on her website that Connors was her new coach. On August 15, 2013 Sharapova confirmed that she had ended the partnership with Connors after just one match together.  Author [ edit ]  In 2013, Connors published his autobiography The Outsider . It won the British Sports Book Awards in the \"Best Autobiography/Biography\" category. [23]   Personal life [ edit ]  Connors was engaged to fellow tennis pro Chris Evert from 1974 to 1975, and they each triumphed in the singles events at the 1974 Wimbledon Championships; a feat labelled \"The Lovebird Double\" by the media. Their engagement was broken off shortly before the 1975 Wimbledon championship. Connors and Evert briefly reconciled in 1976 and 1978, before parting for good. In May 2013, Connors wrote his autobiography in which he alleged that Evert was pregnant with their child and that she unilaterally made the decision to have an abortion. [24] [25] [26]  Former Miss World  Marjorie Wallace was engaged to Connors from 1976 to 1977, but in 1979 Connors married Playboy model Patti McGuire . They have two children, son Brett and daughter Aubree, and live in the Santa Barbara, California area. [27] [28]  In the fall of 1988, Connors auditioned to host the NBC daytime version of Wheel of Fortune , a show he and his wife \"never missed an episode\" of. [29] However, the job went to Rolf Benirschke . According to show creator Merv Griffin , many news outlets tried to get their hands on Connors\\' audition tape, but Griffin refused to release it because he said \"it wouldn\\'t have been fair to Jimmy.\" [30]  In the 1990s, he joined his brother John as investors in the Argosy Gaming Company which owned riverboat casinos on the Mississippi River . The two owned 19 percent of the company which was headquartered in the St. Louis metropolitan area of East Alton, Illinois . [31] Argosy narrowly averted bankruptcy in the late 1990s and Connors\\' brother John personally sought Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In the liquidation, Connors, through his company, Smooth Swing, acquired the Alystra Casino in Henderson, Nevada , for $1.9\\xa0million from Union Planters Bank , which had foreclosed on John. In 1995, John Connors had opened the casino with announced plans to include a Jimmy Connors theme area. [32] It was shuttered in 1998 and became a magnet for the homeless and thieves who stripped its copper piping. The casino never reopened under Connors\\' ownership and it was destroyed in a May 2008 fire. [33]  In October 2005, Connors had successful hip-replacement surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. [34]  On January 8, 2007, Connors\\' mother Gloria died at age 82. [35]  On November 21, 2008, Connors was arrested outside an NCAA basketball game between the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of California at Santa Barbara after refusing to comply with an order to leave an area near the entrance to the stadium. [36] The charges were dismissed by a judge on February 10, 2009. [37] [38]  On July 24, 2018, LiveWire Ergogenics, Inc. announced that Connors joined the firm as a spokesman and advisor. LiveWire Ergogenics focuses on special purpose real estate acquisitions and the licensing and management of fully compliant turnkey production facilities for cannabis-based products and services.

He won a record 23 tennis Majors, [2] including 8 Grand Slam singles titles and, before the Open Era , a record 15 Pro Slam titles; [3] overall, he reached a record 35 Major finals. He won the Pro Grand Slam in 1963. Rosewall won 9 slams in doubles with a career doubles grand slam. He is considered to be one of the greatest tennis players of all time. [4] [5] He had a renowned backhand and enjoyed a long career at the highest levels from the early 1950s to the early 1970s. Rosewall was one of the two best male players for about nine years and was the World No. 1 player for a number of years in the early 1960s. He was ranked among the top 20 players, amateur or professional, every year from 1952 through 1977. Rosewall is the only player to have simultaneously held Pro Grand Slam titles on three different surfaces (1962–1963). At the 1971 Australian Open he became the first male player during the open era to win a Grand Slam tournament without dropping a set. Rosewall won pro world championship tours in 1963, 1964, and the WCT titles in 1971 and 1972. A natural left-hander, he was taught by his father to play right-handed. He developed a powerful and effective backhand but never had anything more than an accurate but relatively soft serve. He was 1.70\\xa0m (5\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in) tall,  weighed 67\\xa0kg (148\\xa0lb) and was ironically nicknamed \"Muscles\" by his fellow-players because of his lack of them. He was, however, fast, agile, and tireless, with a deadly volley. His sliced backhand was his strongest shot, and, along with the very different backhand of former player Don Budge , has generally been considered one of the best, if not the best, backhands yet seen. [6]  The father of two and grandfather of five, Rosewall now lives in northern Sydney.

His father, Robert Rosewall, was a grocer at Penshurst, New South Wales and when Ken was one year old they moved to the Rockdale where his father bought three clay tennis courts. [7] Ken started playing tennis at age three with a shortened racket and using both hands for forehand and backhand shots. [8] They practiced early in the morning, focusing on playing one type of shot for a period of weeks. He was a natural left-hander but was taught to play right-handed by his father. He played his first tournament when he was nine and lost to the eventual winner. At age eleven Rosewall won the Metropolitan Hardcourt Championships for under fourteen. [9] In 1949 at age 14 he became the junior champion at the Australian Hardcourt Championships in Sydney, the youngest player to win an Australian title. [10] [11]   Tennis career [ edit ]  Amateur career: 1950 through 1956 [ edit ]  In October 1950 at the age of 15 and still a junior player, Rosewall reached the semifinals of the 1950 New South Wales Metropolitan Championships (not to be confused with the New South Wales Championships ), where he was defeated by the world-class adult player Ken McGregor . [12] The following year, he won his first men\\'s tournament in Manly .   Ken Rosewall, as a 12 year old at White City , Sydney (1946)  In 1952, still only 17, Rosewall reached the quarterfinals of the U.S. Championships , upsetting the top-seeded Vic Seixas in the fourth round in five sets before losing to Gardnar Mulloy in five sets. [13] In his end-of-year rankings, the British tennis expert Lance Tingay ranked Rosewall and Lew Hoad , his equally youthful doubles partner, jointly as the tenth best amateur players in the world. [14]  Rosewall was only 18 years old when, in 1953, he won his first singles title at a Grand Slam event after defeating compatriot Mervyn Rose at the Australian Championships . [15] He also won the French Championships and the Pacific Southwest Championships . He was the top seed at Wimbledon but lost the quarterfinal match to Kurt Nielsen . [16] Rosewall reached the semifinals at the U.S. Championships, where he was defeated by Tony Trabert in straight sets. [17] He lost again to Trabert in the Challenge Round of the Davis Cup in Melbourne in three sets. Rosewall, however, won the fifth and deciding rubber of that tie, defeating Seixas in four sets. [18] At the end of the year, Tingay placed Trabert first and Rosewall second in his annual amateur rankings. In 1954, Rosewall defeated Trabert in a five-set semifinal at Wimbledon but lost the final to crowd-favorite Jaroslav Drobný in four sets. [19]  Rosewall won the singles title at the Australian Championships for the second time in 1955, defeating Hoad in the final in three sets. He did not play in the 1955 French Championships because it did not fit in the preparation of the Australian team for the Davis Cup. At the U.S. Championships, Trabert defeated Rosewall in the final in three sets. In 1956, Rosewall and Hoad captured all the Grand Slam men\\'s doubles titles except at the French Championships, from which Rosewall was absent. For several years in their youthful careers, Rosewall and Hoad were known as \"The Gold-dust Twins.\"  In singles, Rosewall lost to Hoad in the final of two Grand Slam tournaments. At the Australian Championships, Hoad defeated Rosewall in four sets and at Wimbledon, Hoad won in four sets. Rosewall, however, prevented Hoad from winning the Grand Slam when Rosewall won their final at the U.S. Championships in four sets. During his amateur career, Rosewall helped Australia win three Davis Cup Challenge Rounds ( 1953 , 1955 and 1956 ). Rosewall won 15 of the 17 Davis Cup singles rubbers he played those years, including the last 14 in a row.  Professional career: 1957 through March 1968 [ edit ]   Ken Rosewall (front) and Lew Hoad in the 1954 final of the Eastern Grass Court Championships in South Orange, N.J., USA.  Promoter and former tennis great Jack Kramer tried unsuccessfully to sign the \"Whiz Kids\" ( Lew Hoad and Rosewall) to professional contracts in late 1955. But one year later, Rosewall accepted Kramer\\'s offer on 30 Dec, 1956. [20] Rosewall, during the Challenge Round of the Davis Cup , tried to convince his partner Hoad to do the same, but he rejected the proposition. [21]   1957 [ edit ]  Rosewall played his first professional match on 14 January 1957, at Kooyong Stadium in Melbourne against the reigning king of professional tennis, Pancho Gonzales who won after a close five-set match. [22] The following day Rosewall defeated Gonzales in straight sets. [23] Rosewall explained later that there was a huge gap between the amateur level and the professional level. In their series of head-to-head matches in Australia and the U.S. (until May), Gonzales won 50 matches to Rosewall\\'s 26. During this period, Rosewall also entered two tournaments, the Ampol White City Tournament of Champions at Sydney in February and the U.S. Pro in Cleveland, Ohio in April. At both events he was defeated in the semifinal in straight sets; by Frank Sedgman (second best pro in 1956) and Pancho Segura (third best pro in 1956), respectively. [24] At the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions , a round robin event held in New York, Rosewall defeated Segura and Hoad but lost to Gonzales, Sedgman and Trabert to finish in joint third place. [24]  In September, Rosewall won the Wembley Pro title, beating Segura in a five-set final. This was a significant victory for Rosewall because, of the top professional players, only Sedgman and Tony Trabert did not play. At the end of the year, Rosewall won an Australian tour featuring Lew Hoad , Sedgman, and Segura. [25] Rosewall was offered an undercard position against Trabert for the 1958 world championship tour, but declined.  1958 [ edit ]  At the Kooyong Tournament of Champions at Kooyong in January, the richest tournament of the era, Rosewall finished in fourth place, beating Trabert and Segura, but losing to Sedgman, Hoad, and Gonzales.\\nRosewall was the runner-up at the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions in June. Both he and Gonzales won five round robin matches and lost one but Gonzales claimed the title as he won their head-to-head encounter. Rosewall tied for second (with Pancho Gonzales and Sedgman) behind an undefeated Segura in the Masters Round Robin Pro in Los Angeles in July. Those tournaments were among the most important of the year. Kramer designated Forest Hills, Kooyong, Sydney, and Los Angeles as the four major pro tennis tournaments. [26] [27] In September, Rosewall had the opportunity to show that he was still one of the best players on clay . The previous year, no French Professional Championships (also known as the \"World Pro Championships on Clay\" when organised at Stade Roland Garros ) had been held. This tournament returned in 1958, and Rosewall beat Jack Kramer , Frank Sedgman to reach the final in which he defeated an injured Lew Hoad in four sets to claim the title. [28] At the Wembley Pro, Rosewall lost a close five set semi-final to Trabert.  1959 [ edit ]  In the AMPOL points standings in February, part of a fifteen tournament world circuit, Rosewall finished second with 12 points behind Hoad with 13. [29] [30] [31] For the first time since he turned professional, Rosewall had a favourable 6–4 win-loss record against Pancho Gonzales for the year. Rosewall won both editions of the Queensland Pro Championships in Brisbane , both included in the Ampol world tour, defeating Tony Trabert in the January final in five sets and Gonzales in the December final in four sets. [32] At the Forest Hills Tournament of Champions, Rosewall lost a close semi-final to Hoad in four sets, and beat Trabert to win third place. [33] At the Roland Garros World Professional Championships, Rosewall lost in the semi-final to Trabert, and was beaten by Hoad in the third place match. [34] At the White City Tournament of Champions in Sydney in early December, Rosewall lost in the semif-final to Gonzales in three straight sets. [35] In the final Ampol tournament in the world series, played at Kooyong from December 26, 1959 to January 2, 1960, Rosewall finished runner-up to Hoad, losing the deciding match to Hoad in four close sets.  Kramer acclaimed this match as one of the greatest ever played. Rosewall finished third on the Ampol world championship tour with 41 bonus points, behind Hoad in first place (51 bonus points), and Gonzales in second place (43 bonus points). Rosewall was 2 wins and 6 losses against Hoad on the Ampol tour, and 3 wins and 1 loss against Gonzales on the tour.  1960 [ edit ]   Rosewall (right) and Hoad playing doubles at the Wimbledon Championships in the mid-fifties  The following year Rosewall was incorporated in a new World Pro tour, from January to May, featuring Gonzales, Segura and new recruit Alex Olmedo . This tour was perhaps the peak of Gonzales\\'s entire career. The finals standings were: 1) Gonzales 49 matches won – 8 lost, 2) Rosewall 32–25, 3) Segura 22–28, 4) Olmedo 11–44. Rosewall was therefore far behind Gonzales on this tour, the American having won almost all their direct confrontations (20 wins for Gonzales to 5 wins for Rosewall). Halfway through the North American part of the tour the standings were Gonzales 23–1 (his only match lost in three sets to Olmedo in Philadelphia) and Rosewall 11–13. [36]  Just after Gonzales played and won a minor tournament on 16 May 1960 he decided to retire (as often it was temporary because rapidly needing money Gonzales was back on 30 December 1960). In the absence of Gonzales, Rosewall became the leader, winning six tournaments including the two main tournaments of the year, the French Pro at Roland Garros, defeating Hoad in the final in four sets, and Wembley Pro, defeating Segura. [37] [38] Hoad won four tournaments in 1960, defeating Rosewall in all four finals. [39]   1961 [ edit ]  After ten years of World touring, Rosewall decided to take several long breaks in order to spend time with his family and entered no competitions in the first half of 1961, withdrawing from Kramer\\'s World Professional Championship tour. He trained his long-time friend Hoad when the pros toured in Australia where Gonzales, back to the courts after a \\u200b 7  1 ⁄ 2 -month retirement, won another World tour featuring Hoad (withdrew with injury), Olmedo (replacing Rosewall), Gimeno and the two new recruits MacKay and Buchholz (Segura, Trabert, Cooper and Sedgman sometimes replaced the injured players). In the summer Rosewall returned to the circuit and won the two biggest tournaments (all the best players participating [40] [41] ): the French Pro (clay) and Wembley Pro (wood). At the French he captured the title by beating Gonzales in the final in four sets, and at Wembley he defeated Hoad in the final. [42]  In the summer Rosewall won a short head-to-head tour of France over Gonzales 4-2 and had a 7-4 edge over Gonzales for the entire year. [43]  Rosewall teamed with Hoad to win the inaugural Kramer Cup trophy (the pro equivalent of the Davis Cup) in South Africa.  Rosewall lost to Trabert in the first rubber, but defeated MacKay to set up the fifth and deciding rubber between Hoad and Trabert. After having won on clay and on wood Rosewall ended the season by winning on grass at the New South Wales Pro Championships in Sydney, defeating Butch Buchholz in the final, cementing his status as the best all-court player that year. [44]  Although Gonzales had won Kramer\\'s 1961 World Professional Championship tour, later in the year Rosewall won both Wembley Pro and French Pro, [45] where Gonzales was reported in one source to lose his title. [46] The USPLTA reported Rosewall as the world No. 1 ranked pro followed by Gonzales and Trabert. [47] Robert Roy of L\\'Équipe [48] , Kléber Haedens and Philippe Chatrier of Tennis de France [49] , Michel Sutter (who has published \"Vainqueurs 1946–1991 Winners\") [50] , Christian Boussus (1931 French Championship amateur finalist), Peter Rowley , Robert Geist [51] , Tony Trabert , John Newcombe , Rod Laver and also the New York Times and World Tennis magazine [52] considered Rosewall as the new No. 1 in the world. [ citation needed ]   1962 [ edit ]   Ken Rosewall at an exhibition in Noordwijk in July 1956.  In 1962 Rosewall was the leading pro, winning most pro tournaments of all the players during the year. [53] He retained his Wembley Pro and French Pro crowns and also won tournaments at Adelaide, Melbourne, Christchurch, Auckland, Geneva, Milan and Stockholm. [53] There was no World Series in 1962 and many of the top pros (Rosewall included) did not play pro matches in America during the year. [53]  Per records found, Rosewall lost only 8 matches in 1962\\xa0: Hoad twice (in the Adelaide Professional Indoor Tournament and in the Australian TV series tournament), Gimeno, Ayala, Buchholz, Segura, Anderson and Robert Haillet.  1963 [ edit ]  In an Australasian tour (Australia and New Zealand) played on grass for the Australian portion, Rosewall defeated Laver 11 matches to 2. A US tour followed with Rosewall defending his world pro title [54] [55] [56] [57] against Laver, Gimeno, Ayala and two Americans: Butch Buchholz and Barry MacKay (Hoad was recovering from a shoulder injury). Rosewall entered as defending world pro titlist. In the first phase of this tour, lasting two and a half months, each player faced each other about eight times. Rosewall ended first (31 matches won – 10 lost in front of Laver (26–16), Buchholz (23–18), Gimeno (21–20), MacKay (12–29) and Ayala (11–30)). In this round-robin phase Rosewall beat Laver in the first 5 meetings, ensuring thus a 13-match winning streak (in counting the last 8 matches in Australasia) and Laver won the last 3. Then a second and final phase of the tour opposed the first (Rosewall) and the second (Laver) of the first phase to determine the final winner (the third (Buchholz) met the fourth (Gimeno)). In 18 matches Rosewall beat Laver 14 times to conquer the US tour first place (Gimeno beat Buchholz 11–7) and thus successfully defended his world pro title. [58]  In mid-May the tournament season started. In those occasions Rosewall only beat Laver 4–3 and won 5 tournaments (the same as Laver), but in particular he won the three main tournaments of the year 1963: chronologically the U.S. Pro at Forest Hills (without Gimeno and Sedgman) on grass where he defeated Laver in three straight sets, neither Rosewall nor Laver receiving any payment for the event. [59] the French Pro at Coubertin on wood where his opponent in the final was again Laver who later praised his victor: \"I played the finest tennis I believe I\\'ve ever produced, and he beat me\", [60] Rosewall won the Wembley Pro for the fourth consecutive time after a four-sets win against Hoad in the final. In those tournaments Rosewall won three times while Laver reached two finals and one quarterfinal (Wembley). Rosewall then beat Laver 34 matches to 12.  1964 [ edit ]  In early 1964, Rosewall finished third behind Hoad and Laver in a 4-man 24-match tour of New Zealand. In 1964 Rosewall won one major pro tournament: the French Pro over Laver on an indoor wood surface (at Coubertin). At the end of the South African tour, Rosewall also beat Laver in three straight sets in a Challenge Match considered by some as a World Championship match, on cement, held in Ellis Park, Johannesburg. In the official pro points rankings (7 points for the winner, 4 points for the finalist, 3 points for third, 2 for fourth place and 1 point to each quarterfinalist) taking into account 19 pro tournaments, Rosewall ended No. 1 in 1964 with 78 points beating No. 2 Laver (70 points) and No. 3 Gonzales (48 points). Nevertheless, that ranking a) brushed aside at least 10 tournaments because McCauley has traced at least 29 pro tournaments played by the touring pros (plus some minor tournaments) and several short tours and b) granted each tournament the same points. The majority of tennis observers (Joe McCauley, Robert Geist, Michel Sutter) and the players themselves agreed this points rankings for they considered Rosewall the number one in 1964. Rod Laver himself after his triumph over Rosewall at the Wembley Pro said \"I’ve still plenty of ambitions left and would like to be the world\\'s No. 1. Despite this win, I am not there yet – Ken is. I may have beaten him more often than he has beaten me this year but he has won the biggest tournaments except here. I’ve lost to other people but Ken hasn’t.\". [61]  Laver had a great season and could also claim the top rank. He captured two of the major pro tournaments, a) the U.S. Pro (outside Boston) over Rosewall (suffering from food poisoning) and Gonzales and b) Wembley Pro over Rosewall in one of their best matches ever (Gonzales won arguably the fourth greatest tournament of that year, the U.S. Pro Indoors, at White Plains, defeating in succession Anderson, Laver, Hoad and Rosewall). In 1964, Rosewall beat Gonzales 13 times out of 17, while Laver was beaten by Gonzales 7 times out of 12. In 1964 Laver had a leading win-loss record against Rosewall of 17–7. [62]   1965 [ edit ]  Next year until mid-September Rosewall and Laver were quite equal, the latter winning more tournaments including the US Pro Indoors at New York City and the Masters Pro at Los Angeles but Rosewall won the U.S. Pro on the Longwood C.C. (outside Boston) grass courts crushing Gonzales in three sets and Laver in three sets in the last rounds and again Laver in three sets in the French Pro on the fast wooden courts at Coubertin.  1966 [ edit ]  Laver and Rosewall shared all the titles and the finals of the five greatest tournaments. Rosewall won the Madison Square Garden and the French Pro tournaments over Laver, the latter capturing Forest Hills Pro, the U.S. Pro (outside Boston) and Wembley Pro with Rosewall finalist (or second) each time.  1967 [ edit ]  Rosewall\\'s decline began in 1967. Not only did Laver reach the apogee of his career, but Gimeno threatened Rosewall\\'s second place. The 20 main tournaments of the year were shared by a) Laver, ten titles including the five biggest ones, all played on fast courts (U.S. Pro, French Pro, Wembley Pro, Wimbledon Pro , Madison Square Garden, World Pro in Oklahoma, Boston Pro (not to be confused with the U.S. Pro), Newport R.R., Johannesburg Ellis Park, Coubertin Pro in April (not to be confused with the French Pro at Coubertin in October), b) Rosewall, six titles (Los Angeles, Berkeley, U.S. Pro Hardcourt in St Louis, Newport Beach, Durban and Cape Town), c) Gimeno, three titles (Cincinnati, East London, Port Elizabeth) and d) Stolle, one tournament (Transvaal Pro). Including lesser tournaments Laver\\'s supremacy was even more obvious: 1) Laver 18 tournaments plus two small tours, 2) Rosewall seven tournaments, 3) Stolle four tournaments and 4) Gimeno three tournaments. In head-to-head matches Rosewall trailed Laver 5–8 and was equal with Gimeno 7–7. Before 1967 Gimeno always trailed Rosewall in direct confrontations but that year they split their matches. Rosewall defeated Gimeno in Los Angeles, Madison Square Garden, St Louis, Newport, Johannesburg (challenge match), Durban and Wembley whereas Gimeno won in Cincinnati, U.S. Pro, East London, Port Elizabeth, Johannesburg (tournament), Marseille, French Pro. Forbidden to contest the greatest traditional events, Davis Cup and Grand Slams, during nearly eleven and a half years from 1957 to 30 March 1968, Rosewall reached his best level during this period, in particular from 1960 to 1966, by winning at least 62 tournaments (including 16 less-than-eight-man events) and seven small tours.  Open-closed career: April 1968 through July 1972 [ edit ]  1968 [ edit ]  During the 1968 season several categories of players coexisted:  Amateur players, dependent on their national and international federations, allowed to play the amateur events and open events but forbidden to receive official prize money  Registered players, also dependent on their national and international federations, eligible to play the Davis Cup and forbidden to play pro events as an amateur, but authorised to take prize money in the open events (e.g. Okker)  Professionals under contract with the National Tennis League (NTL)  Professionals under contract with the World Championship Tennis (WCT)  Freelance professionals (e.g. Hoad, Ayala, Owen Davidson and Mal Anderson ).   Ken Rosewall (1970)  In 1968 there were a) an amateur circuit including the Davis Cup (closed to any \"contract\" professional until 1973) and the Australian Championships, b) two pro circuits: WCT and NTL, which met at four tournaments, and c) an open circuit (with a little more than 10 tournaments). At the beginning of the open era WCT founder Dave Dixon did not allow his players to enter tournaments where NTL players were present: there were no WCT players at the first two open tournaments, the British Hard Court Championships and French Open , while all the NTL players were present. The first tournament where NTL and WCT players competed against each other, was the U.S. Pro , held at Longwood in June. Several events were still reserved to the amateur players between 1968 and 1972. Two tournaments were at the top in 1968: Wimbledon (a 128-man field), and the US Open (a 100-man field), both played on grass, where all the best players competed. Other notable tournaments that year were the Queen\\'s Club tournament and the greatest pro tournaments where all the NTL and WCT pros competed (but without amateur or registered players) as the U.S. Pro (outside Boston, on grass), the French Pro (coming back to Roland Garros after the 5-edition interlude at Coubertin), the first Pacific Southwest Open in Los Angeles (64-man field) with all the best players present, the Jack Kramer Tournament of Champions at Wembley in November and the Madison Square Garden Pro in December with the four best pros of each organisation. In this context Rosewall played almost all NTL pro tournaments in 1968, the four \"NTL-WCT\" tournaments and some open tournaments. He entered his first open tournament at 33 years at Bournemouth on clay (the WCT players did not take part) and defeated Gimeno and Laver to win the first open tennis title. At the French Open , the first Grand Slam tournament of the Open Era , Rosewall confirmed his status of best claycourt player in the world by defeating Laver in the final in four sets. [63] Defeats followed against some of the upcoming 1967 amateur players (Roche twice on grass at the US Pro and at Wimbledon, Newcombe on clay at the French Pro and Okker on grass at the U.S. Open) but his end of the year was better. He reached the semifinals of the US Open, was finalist to Laver at the Pacific Southwest Open, defeating the new US Open winner, Arthur Ashe , and in November captured the Wembley Pro tournament over WCT player, John Newcombe. At age 34 Rosewall was still ranked No. 3 in the world behind Laver and Ashe according to Lance Tingay and Bud Collins .  1969 [ edit ]  His true decline, having begun in 1967, was confirmed in 1969. Rosewall was no longer the best claycourt player as Laver had stolen his crown in the final of the French Open at Roland Garros. Rosewall was ranked No. 4 that year by Collins and Tingay and won three tournaments (Bristol, Chicago, Midland). At age 35 he had won almost all the great events except for Wimbledon, and subsequently this tournament became Rosewall\\'s priority. The Wimbledon crown had eluded him during his 11-year professional career (1957–1967), when he was excluded from entering the event, at a time when he was at his best—particularly between 1961 and 1965 (except 1964) when he was arguably the best grasscourt player in the world. Realising that if he reached the last rounds of the French Open he could be too tired to play well at Wimbledon (as had happened in 1968 and 1969, when he lost in the fourth and third rounds respectively), Rosewall decided not to play the French Open any more in the seventies in order to be in optimal condition for Wimbledon. [ citation needed ]   1970 [ edit ]  Being an NTL player at the beginning of 1970 he didn\\'t play the Australian Open held at the White City Stadium in Sydney in January because NTL boss, George McCall, and his players thought that the prize money was too low for a Grand Slam tournament. In March, a tournament, sponsored by Dunlop, was organised at the same site, with a higher quality field because of better prize-money and a better date. The same class players as in the Australian Open were present and in addition not only the NTL pros participated but also some independent pros, such as Ilie Năstase , who usually did not make the trip to Australia. Laver won the tournament after defeating Rosewall in a five-set final watched by a crowd of 8,000. [64] As both the NTL and the WCT boycotted the Roland Garros tournament because it refused to pay guarantees Rosewall also missed the second Grand Slam tournament of the year. [65] [66] All the best players met again at Wimbledon . This time a rested Rosewall reached the final and took Newcombe, his junior by \\u200b 9  1 ⁄ 2 -years, to five sets but ultimately succumbed. [67] In July Rosewall became a WCT player after that organisation took over the NTL and its players. [68] Two months later at the U.S. Open, one of the two 1970 Grand Slams with all the best players, Rosewall won over Newcombe in their semifinal match in three straight sets before defeating Tony Roche in the final to win his sixth Grand Slam tournament.   Ken Rosewall in Scheveningen (1970)  To fight against the WCT and NTL promoters, who controlled their own players and did not allow them to compete where they wanted, Kramer introduced the Grand Prix tennis circuit in December 1969, open to all players. The first Grand Prix circuit was held in 1970 and comprised 20 tournaments from April to December. These tournaments gave points according to their categories and the players\\' performances with the top six ranked players invited to a season-ending tournament called the Masters . All the amateurs and independent pros fully invested themselves in this circuit while the contract pros firstly played their own circuit and eventually played in some Grand Prix tournaments. Rosewall and Laver performed well in both circuits. Rosewall was ranked third in the Grand Prix standings and finished third in the Masters behind winner Stan Smith and his 1970 nemesis Laver. [69] Rosewall earned $140,455 in prize money. After his 1967–1969 steady decline, 1970 saw a rejuvenated Rosewall who was just one set short of winning the Wimbledon and U.S. Open double. 1970 was a year where no player dominated the circuit, the seven leading tournaments were won by seven different players, and different arguments were given to designate the World No. 1. Some, among them Newcombe and the panel of journalists which made the 1971 WCT draw, considered Laver the best player because he won most tournaments (15), earned the most prize money and had a dominantly positive head-to-head record against both Rosewall (5–0) and Newcombe (3–0). But Laver failed at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, the two big tournaments, losing each time in the round of 16. Other tennis pundits, as Joe McCauley (World Tennis) or Lance Tingay (Daily Telegraph), narrowly ranked Newcombe first because he won the most prestigious tournament, Wimbledon with Rosewall second and Laver third or (McCauley) fourth (Tingay).  Judith Elian of the French sports paper L\\'Équipe ranked Rosewall as the number one player ahead of Newcombe and the panel of experts for the \\'Martini and Rosso\\' Cup also had Rosewall first, narrowly over Laver. Meanwhile, in his book (see above) Robert Geist ranked the three Australians equal number ones [70] .[full citation needed,self-published?]  1971 [ edit ]  After his runner-up finishes at Sydney and Wimbledon and his victory at the US Open in 1970, Rosewall continued his good performances in 1971 in the great grass court tournaments. One year after the first Dunlop Open was held in Sydney, Rosewall was back in Sydney in March, this time for the Australian open held on the White City Courts. Because it was sponsored by Dunlop in 1971, all the World Championship Tennis (WCT) players (including the National Tennis League players since spring 1970) entered ( John Newcombe , Rosewall, Rod Laver , Tony Roche , Tom Okker , Arthur Ashe ) as well as some independent pros. Only Stan Smith (Army\\'s service), Cliff Richey , Clark Graebner , and the clay specialist players Ilie Năstase and Jan Kodeš were missing. Rosewall won the tournament, his second consecutive Grand Slam win and his seventh overall Grand Slam title, without losing a set and defeated Roy Emerson and Okker before beating Ashe in the final in straight sets. Rosewall and most other WCT players did not play the French Open; yet, Rosewall still tried to reach his seventies goal by winning Wimbledon. In the quarterfinals, Rosewall needed about four hours to defeat Richey in five sets whereas Newcombe quickly defeated Colin Dibley . In the semifinals, the older Rosewall was no match for the fitter Newcombe and lost in straight sets. Later in the summer, Rosewall and some other WCT players (Laver, Andrés Gimeno , Emerson, Cliff Drysdale , Fred Stolle , and Roche) did not play the US Open because of the growing conflict between the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) and the WCT. His children\\'s illnesses was an additional reason for Rosewall not playing this tournament. As a contract pro, Rosewall was not allowed to play the Davis Cup and thus concentrated mainly on the WCT circuit organised similarly to the Grand Prix circuit which was the equivalent for the independent pros: 20 tournaments (including the Australian Open), each giving the same points amount. The top eight players in ranking points were invited to the WCT Finals, an eight-man tournament, equivalent of the Grand Prix Masters for the WCT players, played in November in Houston and Dallas , USA. When the WCT players were off they could play tournaments on the Grand Prix circuit. Some tournaments such as Berkeley, which had a stronger field than the US Open, were organised by both organisations. But the war between the ILTF and WCT climaxed in a ban by the ILTF beginning on 1 January 1972, of the WCT players from the Grand Prix circuit. Rosewall ended third on the 1971 WCT circuit behind Laver and Okker and qualified for the WCT Finals . He won the title, beating Newcombe in the quarterfinals, defeating Okker in the semifinals and beating Laver in a four-sets final in what was considered at the time as the best match, with their 1970 Sydney final, between the two rivals since their 1968 French Open final. [71] [72] As a WCT player Rosewall played few Grand Prix tournaments but he had earned enough points to play the Grand Prix Masters held about ten days after his WCT Finals. He refused the invitation as he was tired after a long season and took his holidays at the end of the year. [ citation needed ]  In 1971 Rosewall won eight tournaments and 76 out of 97 matches (78%) and in direct confrontations trailed Newcombe 1–3, Laver 2–3 but led Smith 1–0. Collins and Elian ranked Rosewall third after Newcombe and/or Smith. Tingay ranked Rosewall 4th, Rino Tommasi 1st, and the Martini-Rossi award was given jointly to Smith and Newcombe. Geist ranked Rosewall co-No. 1 tied with Newcombe and Smith. That year, as in 1970, there was no clear undisputed World No. 1.  1972 [ edit ]  1972 saw a return to separate circuits because all traditional ILTF events held from January to July were forbidden to the WCT players. This included the Davis Cup but also Roland Garros and Wimbledon. The 1972 Australian Open organisers used a trick to avoid the ban of the WCT players. They held the tournament from 27 December 1971, four days before the ban could be applied, to 3 January 1972. Thus all contract as well as independent pros could enter but few were interested because it was held during Christmas and New Year\\'s Day period. The draw included only eight non-Australian players. Rosewall reached the final in which he defeated Mal Anderson to win his fourth Australian title and the eight, and last, Grand Slam title of his career. [73] [74] A fragile agreement in the spring of 1972 let the WCT players come back to the traditional circuit in August (in Merion, WCT players Okker and Roger Taylor played). The US Open, won by Ilie Năstase, was the greatest event of the year as only in this tournament were all the best players present with the exception of Tony Roche who suffered from a tennis elbow. Later that year two other tournaments had good fields with WCT and independent pros: the Pacific Southwest Open at Los Angeles and, to a lesser extent, Stockholm, both won by Stan Smith. In many 1972 rankings there were six or seven WCT players in the world top 10 (the three or four independent pros were Smith, Năstase, Orantes and sometimes Gimeno) so the $100,000 season-ending WCT Finals held in May in Dallas were considered as one of the major events of the year. The final, played between Rosewall and Laver, was considered one of the two best matches played in 1972, the other being the Wimbledon final, and the best Rosewall-Laver match of the open era. It was broadcast nationally in the U.S., viewed by twenty-three million people, and became known as the \"match that made tennis in the United States.\" Rosewall won the last major title of his long career by defeating Laver in an epic five-set match which was decided by a tiebreak. [75] [76] [77] (Laver wrote that the two Australians had played better matches between them in the pre-open days, citing their 1963 French Pro final as the pinnacle; McCauley considered their 1964 Wembley final). Because of the ILTF\\'s ban once again Rosewall could not enter Wimbledon.  Open career: August 1972 through 1980 (and 1982) [ edit ]  1972 [ edit ]  From August 1972 players could enter almost all the tournaments they wanted. The Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) was created during the US Open. Rosewall won seven tournaments in 1972, including the depleted Australian Open and became the oldest Grand Slam male singles champion (37 years and 2 months old) in the open era, [a] and was ranked, by Judith Elian or Tingay or McCauley, No. 3 behind Smith and Ilie Năstase (Bud Collins permuting Năstase and Rosewall). He lost in the second round of the 1972 U.S. Open against Mark Cox.  1973 [ edit ]  For Rosewall the beginning of 1973 was identical to the second half of 1972: a desert. He recorded possibly his worst defeat in his whole career at the 1973 Australian Open (again with a weak field because as in 1972 among the Top 20 only Rosewall and Newcombe participated) when seeded first he was defeated by German Karl Meiler in his first match (second round) in straight sets. Between May 1972 (victory at Dallas) and April 1973 (victory at Houston, River Oaks) Rosewall captured only two minor titles, Tokyo WCT (not giving points for the WCT Finals) and Brisbane (in December 1972) where he was the only Top 20 player. If 1967 has been the first year of a relative decline with however many highlights, 1973 (and more accurately his \"after-Dallas 1972\") has been the real start of Rosewall\\'s true decline\\xa0: admittedly he was still one of the best players but not one fighting for the first place. Rosewall did not play Wimbledon that year as the edition was boycotted by the ATP players. After an absence of 17 years Rosewall returned to Davis Cup play in November when he played a doubles match with Rod Laver in the interzonal final against Czechoslovakia . [78]  His best performances in 1973 were firstly his semifinal at the US Open (as in 1972 the greatest event of the year) and secondly his third place at the WCT Finals (he was beaten by Ashe in the semifinals and defeated Laver for 3rd place). He also won at Houston WCT, Cleveland WCT, Charlotte WCT, Osaka and Tokyo. He was still ranked in the top 10. Tommasi ranked Rosewall 4, Tingay 6, ATP 6, Collins 5, and McCauley 7.  1974–1982 [ edit ]  1974 was the first year since 1952 that Rosewall did not win a single tournament. However, he entered nine tournaments (the one at Hong Kong not finished because of rain) and reached three finals including Wimbledon and US Open . This was his last Wimbledon final, at the age of 39. Despite the strong support of the crowd, who were eager to see him finally claim a Wimbledon title, he lost to the 18 years younger Jimmy Connors . [79] [80] Due to the two last strong performances he was ranked between second (Tingay) and the seventh place (Collins) by many tennis journalists. He ranked only 8th in the ATP rankings because he played too few tournaments knowing that he succumbed to the charms of the World Team Tennis \"organisation\". Rosewall coached the Pittsburgh Triangles team in 1974. He still stayed in the Top 10 (ATP, Collins, Tommasi) or the Top 15 in 1975 winning 5 tournaments (Jackson, Houston-River Oaks, Louisville, Gstaad, Tokyo Gunze Open) and his two singles in Davis Cup against New Zealand (this event has been finally open to contract pros in 1973\\xa0: that year Rosewall was selected by Neale Fraser for the semifinals doubles). Rosewall made his last attempt at Wimbledon, at over 40, and as in his first Wimbledon Open (in 1968) he lost in the same round (4th) and against the same player (Tony Roche). In 1976 Rosewall dropped out of the Top 10 but stayed in the Top 20 as he won three tournaments: Brisbane, Jackson WCT and Hong Kong (over Năstase then the 3rd player in the world). 1977 was Rosewall\\'s last year in the Top 20, which means he was one of the best players for 26 years (in the Top 20 from 1952 to 1977). In January he reached the semifinal of the 1977 Australian Open , losing in four sets to eventual champion Roscoe Tanner . [81] He won his last two tournaments titles in Hong Kong and Tokyo (Gunze Open) respectively at the age of 43. [82] [83] Rosewall played in the Sydney Indoor Tournament in October 1977. Approaching his 43rd birthday he beat the No. 3 in the world Vitas Gerulaitis in a straight-sets semifinal and put in a credible performance losing to Jimmy Connors in the final in three straight sets. The following year he lost in the semifinals at 44 years of age. Afterwards, he gradually retired. In October 1980 at the Melbourne indoor tournament, at nearly 46 years of age, Rosewall defeated American Butch Walts , ranked World No. 49, in the first round before losing to Paul McNamee . Rosewall made a very brief comeback at 47 years of age in a non-ATP tournament, the New South Wales Hardcourt Championships in Grafton in February 1982, where he reached the final, losing to Brett Edwards in two sets.  Rivalries [ edit ]  Main articles: Laver–Rosewall rivalry and Gonzales–Rosewall rivalry  Gonzales and Laver are the two players that Rosewall most often met. His meetings with Laver are better documented and detailed than those with Gonzales. Except the first year (1963) and the last year they played (1976), the statistics of their meetings show a domination by Laver; but they are biased before when Rosewall was the better of the two Australians in 1963.\\nIn the Open Era a match score of 23–9 in favour of Laver can be documented, overall a score of 80–64. Including tournaments and one-night stands, Rosewall and Gonzales played at least 182 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours either lost or partially recorded. A match score of 107–75 in favor of Gonzales can be documented.  Playing style and assessment [ edit ]  In his 1979 autobiography, Kramer wrote that \"Rosewall was a backcourt player when he came into the pros, but he learned very quickly how to play the net. Eventually, for that matter, he became a master of it, as much out of physical preservation as for any other reason. I guarantee you that Kenny wouldn\\'t have lasted into his forties as a world-class player if he hadn\\'t learned to serve and volley .\" His one-handed backhand which he usually played with backspin was rated as one of the best backhand shots in the history of the game. [84] [85] [86]  Kramer included the Australian in his list of the 21 greatest players of all time, albeit in the second echelon. [b]  During his long playing career he remained virtually injury-free, something that helped him to still win tournaments at the age of 43 and remain ranked in the top 15 in the world. Although he was a finalist 4 times at Wimbledon , and also at the Wimbledon Pro in 1967, it was the one major tournament that eluded him. Rosewall was a finalist at the 1974 US Open at 39 years 310 days old, making him the oldest player to participate in two Grand Slam finals in the same year. Before that, in 1972 Rosewall won the Australian Open final at age 37 and 2 months making him the oldest male player to win a Grand Slam singles title as of 2017. In 1995 Pancho Gonzales said of him: \"He became better as he got older, more of a complete player. With the exception of me and Frank Sedgman , he could handle everybody else. Just the way he played, he got under Hoad\\'s skin, but he had a forehand weakness and a serve weakness.\"  In 201 matches against Gonzales he won 85 and lost 116. In 135 matches against Lew Hoad he won 84 and lost 51. [87]  In the 2012 Tennis Channel series \"100 Greatest of All Time\" Rosewall was ranked number 13 among all time male tennis players, with only two Australian tennis players ranked ahead of him, Laver and Emerson.

Personal life [ edit ]  Ken Rosewall married Wilma McIver at St. John\\'s Cathedral, Brisbane, Queensland on 6 October 1956. It was described in press reports as Brisbane\\'s society wedding of the year with over 2000 people in attendance outside the church, and 800 guests in the Cathedral. [103] The couple then moved to Turramurra, New South Wales and have lived there ever since. Ken Rosewall was a non Executive Director of the failed stockbroking firm BBY and his son, Glenn Rosewall, was the company\\'s Executive Director. [104]   Honours [ edit ]  In the Queen\\'s Birthday Honours of 1971, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). [105] In the Australia Day Honours of 1979, he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM). Rosewall was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in 1980. In 1985 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame . [106] He is an Australian Living Treasure . The Sydney Olympic Park Tennis Centre\\'s central court is the Ken Rosewall Arena, a covered arena.

The next four best were, chronologically, Bill Tilden , Fred Perry , Bobby Riggs , and Pancho Gonzales . After these six came the \"second echelon\" of Rod Laver , Lew Hoad , Ken Rosewall, Gottfried von Cramm , Ted Schroeder , Jack Crawford , Pancho Segura , Frank Sedgman , Tony Trabert , John Newcombe , Arthur Ashe , Stan Smith , Björn Borg , and Jimmy Connors . He felt unable to rank Henri Cochet and René Lacoste accurately but felt they were among the very best.

[5]  Before turning professional, Flach played tennis for Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville , where he won the NCAA Division II singles championships in 1981, 1982 and 1983, and teamed with Seguso to reach the 1983 Division I doubles final. [6]  Flach married his first wife, model Sandra Freeman, in September of 1986 and had four children together. [5]   Career [ edit ]  Flach played doubles on the U.S. Davis Cup team from 1985–1991, compiling an 11–2 record. He was also a member of the U.S. team which won the World Team Cup in 1985. During his career, Flach won 36 doubles titles (34 men\\'s doubles and 2 mixed doubles). His final career title was won in 1994 at Scottsdale, Arizona. Following his retirement from the professional tour in 1996, Flach devoted himself to coaching. He guided Vanderbilt University to its first NCAA tournament berth in 1999. In 2003, he led the team to Vanderbilt\\'s first NCAA championship finals appearance in any sport. He had also played in seniors events, and won the Wimbledon 35-and-over men\\'s doubles title in 1999 and 2000. [4]  In 2010, after moving to California, he married makeup entrepreneur Christina Friedman, and became the director of tennis at Novato\\'s Rolling Hills Club. [7] [8] [9]   Death [ edit ]  In early March of 2018, Flach became ill with bronchitis after playing 36 holes of golf. According to his widow, Flach\\'s doctors at Kaiser Permanente failed to act with urgency allowing the infection to turn life-threatening. Christina Flach claims that rather than have Ken come in for an appointment, an advice nurse spent time assessing his health in a telephone conversation. She claims that when Ken Flach began vomiting blood, he sent a desperate email to his doctor at Kaiser Permanente before the pair rushed to the emergency room, where he was intubated. He was later transferred to University of California San Francisco Medical Center with his organs failing. Ken Flach was removed from life support and died of sepsis several days later, on March 12. [10]  Christina Flach is now a volunteer with Sepsis Alliance working to educate others about the condition that killed her husband.

Pro tour [ edit ]   Björkman and Woodbridge at Wimbledon 2004  He is best known as one of the top doubles players in the world for most of the 1990s and into the early 2000s (decade). His primary doubles partnerships were first with fellow Australian Mark Woodforde and later with Swede  Jonas Björkman . Woodbridge and Woodforde are often referred to as \" The Woodies \" in the tennis world. Woodbridge also had a career high singles ranking of 19 after reaching the semifinals of Wimbledon in 1997, beating Michael Chang , Marcos Ondruska , Alex Rădulescu , Patrick Rafter and Nicolas Kiefer before losing to Pete Sampras . He did however have the distinction of being one of only seven players to beat Sampras at Wimbledon, knocking him out in the first round in 1989 (Sampras\\'s first ever Wimbledon match). The Woodies won a record 61 ATP doubles titles as a team, including 11 Grand Slam events. Woodforde and Woodbridge won a gold medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics , and reached the final to win a silver medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics . In the fourth set tie-breaker against Canadians Sébastien Lareau and Daniel Nestor , Woodbridge served a double fault to lose the match. After Woodforde retired from the tour in 2000, Woodbridge established a partnership with Björkman that resulted in five Grand Slam titles in four years. At the end of 2004, Björkman ended his partnership with Woodbridge. According to an interview Woodbridge granted to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Björkman wanted him to play more weeks on the tour, but Woodbridge wanted to limit his time away from his family as much as possible. Woodbridge then took on India\\'s Mahesh Bhupathi as his new partner, who had just been dumped by Belarusian  Max Mirnyi . Coincidentally, Björkman and Mirnyi ended up partnering together. Woodbridge announced his retirement at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships after 17 years as a tennis professional and 83 ATP tournament doubles titles, an all-time record at the time now surpassed by the Bryan brothers . He was a member of the Australian Davis Cup Team , playing the most ties (32) of any player.

He was the No. 1 ranked professional from 1964 to 1970, spanning four years before and three years after the start of the Open Era in 1968. He also was the No. 1 ranked amateur in 1961–62. [3]  Laver\\'s 200 singles titles are the most in tennis history. This included his all-time men\\'s record of 10 or more titles per year for seven consecutive years (1964–70). He excelled on all of the court surfaces of his time: grass, clay, hard, carpet, and wood/parquet. Laver won 11 Grand Slam singles titles, though he was banned from playing those tournaments for the five years prior to the Open Era. Laver is the only player to twice achieve a Grand Slam, in 1962 and 1969, and the latter remains the only time a man has done so in the Open Era. He also won eight Pro Slam titles, including the \"pro Grand Slam\" [4] [5] in 1967, and he contributed to five Davis Cup titles for Australia during an age when the Davis Cup was deemed as significant as the four majors. [6]  The Laver Cup Tournament is named after him.

[8] [9] He was the third of four children of Roy Laver, a cattleman and butcher, and his wife Melba Roffey. [10]  In 1966, Laver, aged 27, married Mary Benson in San Rafael , California. Born Mary Shelby Peterson in Illinois, she was a divorcee with three children. [11] [12] After their wedding ceremony, a group of well-known tennis players in attendance, including Lew Hoad , Ken Rosewall , Roy Emerson , Mal Anderson and Barry MacKay , stood outside the church with raised tennis rackets that formed an archway for the newlyweds to walk under. [12] [13] Laver and Mary had a son and the family lived at various locations in California including Rancho Mirage , Corona del Mar , a ranch near Santa Barbara and Carlsbad . [12] Mary Laver died in November 2012 at the age of 84 at their home in Carlsbad. [12]   Career [ edit ]  Amateur (1956–62) [ edit ]  Laver was a teenager when he left school to pursue a tennis career that lasted 24 years. He was coached in Queensland by Charlie Hollis and later by the Australian Davis Cup team captain Harry Hopman , who gave Laver the nickname \"Rocket\". Laver was both Australian and US Junior champion in 1957. He had his breakthrough on the world stage in 1959, when he reached all three finals at Wimbledon , winning the mixed doubles title with Darlene Hard . As an unseeded player, he lost the singles final to Peruvian Alex Olmedo after surviving an 87-game semifinal against American Barry MacKay . His first major singles title was the Australian Championships in 1960, where he defeated fellow Australian Neale Fraser in a five-set final after coming back from two sets down and saving a Fraser championship point in the fourth set. Laver captured his first Wimbledon singles crown in 1961.   Rod Laver signing autographs at the Dutch Championships in July 1962  In 1962, Laver became the first male player since Don Budge in 1938 to win all four Grand Slam singles titles in the same year. He won an additional 18 titles, for a season total of 22 [14] . Among those titles were the Italian Championships and the German Championships , giving Laver the \"clay court triple\" of Paris, Rome, and Hamburg that had been achieved previously only by Lew Hoad in 1956. The biggest hurdle to Laver\\'s winning the Grand Slam was the French Championships on slow clay, where Laver won three consecutive five-setters beginning with the quarterfinals. In his quarterfinal with Martin Mulligan , Laver saved a matchpoint in the fourth set with a backhand volley after coming to the net behind a second serve. In the final, Laver lost the first two sets and was down 0–3 in the fourth set before coming back to defeat Roy Emerson . At Wimbledon, his progress was much easier. Laver lost only one set the whole tournament, to Manuel Santana in a quarterfinal, who held a set point for a two set lead. At the US Championships , Laver lost only two sets during the tournament and defeated Emerson again in the final. In February 1963, he appeared on the panel game show To Tell the Truth , where all four panelists identified him based on his knowledge of the history of tennis. [15]   Professional [ edit ]  Before the Open Era (1963–68) [ edit ]  In December 1962 Laver turned professional after winning the Davis Cup with the Australian team . After an initial period of adjustment he quickly established himself among the leading professional players such as Ken Rosewall , Lew Hoad and Andrés Gimeno , and also Pancho Gonzales when Gonzales returned to a full-time schedule in 1964. During the next seven years, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times, including four in a row beginning in 1966. In the beginning of 1963, Laver was beaten consistently by both Rosewall and Hoad on an Australasian tour. Hoad won the first eight matches against Laver, and Rosewall won 11 out of 13. [16] By the end of the year, however, with six tournament titles, Laver had become the No. 2 professional player behind Rosewall. [17] [18] [19] In the first phase of the World Series tour, Laver finished second, with a 25-16 record. The top two players Rosewall and Laver then played a series of matches against each other to determine the champion. Rosewall won 14-4. In 1964, Laver and Rosewall both won seven important titles (in minor tournaments Laver won four and Rosewall won three), but Laver won 15 of 19 matches against Rosewall and captured the two most prestigious titles, the US Pro Championships over Gonzales and the Wembley Championships over Rosewall. In tennis week, Raymond Lee has described the Wembley match, where Laver came from 5–3 down in the fifth set to win 8–6, as possibly their best ever and one that changed tennis history. Lee regards this win as the one that began and established Laver\\'s long reign as world number one. The other prestige title, the French pro, was won by Rosewall.   Rod Laver at Noordwijk in 1964  In 1965, Laver was clearly the No. 1 professional player, [20] winning 17 titles [21] and 13 of 18 matches against Rosewall. In ten finals, Laver won eight against the still dangerous Gonzales. In 1966, Laver won 16 events, [21] including the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championship, and eight other important tournaments. In 1967, Laver won 19 titles, [21] including the Wimbledon Pro , the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships , and the French Pro Championship , which gave him a clean sweep of the most important professional titles, a professional Grand Slam. The Wimbledon Pro tournament in 1967 was the only professional event ever staged on Wimbledon\\'s  Centre Court before the Open Era began. Laver beat Rosewall in the final in three straight sets.  During the Open Era (1968–76) [ edit ]  With the dawn of the Open Era in 1968, professional players were once again allowed to compete in Grand Slam events. Laver became Wimbledon\\'s first Open Era champion in 1968, beating the best amateur, American Arthur Ashe , in a semifinal and fellow-Australian Tony Roche in the final, both in straight sets. [22] [23] Laver was also the runner-up to Ken Rosewall in the first French Open. In this first \"open\" year, there were only eight open events besides Wimbledon and the French Open, where professionals, registered players, and amateurs could compete against each other. The professionals mainly played their own circuit, with two groups – National Tennis League (NTL) and World Championships Tennis (WCT)\\xa0– operating. Laver was ranked No. 1 universally, winning the US Professional Championships on grass and the French Pro Championship on clay (both over John Newcombe ). [24] Laver also won the last big open event of the year, the Pacific Southwest in Los Angeles on hard courts. [25] Ashe regarded Laver\\'s 4–6, 6–0, 6–0 final win over Ken Rosewall as one of his finest performances. [26] Laver\\'s post-match comment was, \"This is the kind of match you always dream about. The kind you play at night in your sleep.\" In 1969, Laver won all four Grand Slam tournaments in the same calendar year for the second time, sealing the achievement with a four-set win over Roche in the US Open final. He won 18 of the 32 singles tournaments he entered (still the Open Era titles record ) and compiled a 106–16 win-loss record. In beating Newcombe in four sets in the Wimbledon final, he captured the title at the All England Club for the fourth consecutive time that he had entered the tournament (and reached the final for the sixth consecutive time as he had been runner-up in 1959 and 1960). He set a record of 31 consecutive match victories at Wimbledon between 1961 and 1970, which lasted until 1980 when it was eclipsed by Björn Borg . Unlike his first Grand Slam year in 1962, Laver in 1969 played in events open to all the best professional and amateur players of the world. In the year\\'s Grand Slam tournaments, Laver had five five-set-matches, twice coming back from two sets down in early rounds. In the four finals, however, he lost a total of only two sets. His hardest match was a marathon 90-game semifinal against Roche at the Australian Open under tropical hot conditions. Other opponents at the Australian Open included Roy Emerson , Fred Stolle , and Andrés Gimeno . At the French Open, Laver beat Gimeno, Tom Okker , and Rosewall. At Wimbledon, Laver overcame strong challenges from Stan Smith , Cliff Drysdale , Ashe, and Newcombe. At the US Open on slippery grass courts, he defeated Dennis Ralston , Emerson, Ashe, and Roche. Laver proved his versatility by winning the Grand Slam tournaments on grass and clay, plus the two most important hard court titles (South African Open at Ellis Park, Johannesburg and the US Professional Championships at Boston) and the leading indoor tournaments (Philadelphia US Pro Indoor and Wembley British Indoor). With US$124,000 in prize money, he was also the first player to break the US$100,000 barrier in a year. In the early 1970s, Laver lost his grip on the major tournaments. He played only five Grand Slam tournaments from 1970 through 1972. This was partly because of his contracts with NTL and WCT. But on the WCT tours, he remained the leading player and by far the leading prize money winner.   Rod Laver at the 1976 ABN World Tennis Tournament in Rotterdam  In 1970, Laver won 15 titles [21] and US$201,453 in prize money, including the rich \"Tennis Champions Classic\" and five other big events (Sydney Dunlop Open, Philadelphia, Wembley, Los Angeles, South African Open). Those were the equivalent of the modern day ATP Masters Series and most had 8 or more of the world\\'s top ranked players participating. With only two majors played by all the best players (Wimbledon and the US Open), there was no clear-cut World No. 1 in 1970. Wimbledon champion Newcombe, US champion Rosewall, and Laver (who won the most titles and had a 3–0 win-loss record against Newcombe and a 5–0 record against Rosewall) were ranked the highest by different journalists and expert panels.  The panel of 10 international journalists who voted for the \\'Martini and Rossi\\' Award, ranked Rosewall No. 1 with 97 points over Laver (89 pts) and Newcombe (81 pts).  The panel of 12 journalists which made the WCT draw for 1971 ranked Laver 1st, Rosewall 2nd and Newcombe 3rd. Judith Elian of L\\'Equipe Magazine (Paris) placed Rosewall No. 1, while and Robert Geist co-ranked Rosewall, Laver and Newcombe No. 1.  Newcombe later wrote in his autobiography \"Newk-Life On and Off the Court\" (2002) that the top honour for 1970 belonged to Laver.  A minority of journalists – Lance Tingay, John McCauley and Bud Collins – ranked Newcombe ahead of Rosewall and Laver. In 1971 he won seven titles, [21] including the Italian Open in Rome on clay over Jan Kodeš , the reigning French Open champion. Laver successfully defended his title at the \"Tennis Champions Classic\", winning 13 consecutive winner-take-all matches against top opponents and US$160,000. For the year, Laver won a then-record US$292,717 in tournament prize money and became the first tennis player to surpass US$1\\xa0million in career prize money. In 1971 and 1972, Laver finished as the points leader of the WCT tournament series but lost the playoff finals at Dallas to Rosewall. The last match is rated as one of the best of all time and drew a TV audience of over 20\\xa0million. In 1972, Laver cut back his tournament schedule, partly because of back and knee injuries and his tennis camp businesses, but he still won five titles [21] that year. In 1973, Laver won seven titles [21] and successfully participated in the semifinals and final of the Davis Cup , where he won all six of his rubbers for Australia. In 1974 Laver won six titles [21] from 13 tournaments and ended the year as World No. 4 based on the ATP point system. At 36, he was the oldest player during the Open Era to have been included in the year-ending top five. In 1975, Laver set a record for WCT tournaments by winning four titles and 23 consecutive matches but in 1976, he semi-retired from the main tour, playing only a few selected events. He also signed with World Team Tennis , where he became \"Rookie of the Year\" at the age of 38 but won five titles [27] overall that season. Overall, despite turning 30 just months after the Open Era began, Laver had tremendous success, winning 74 singles titles, which remains seventh most of the era . Plus, like most players of his day, he regularly played doubles, winning 37 titles.  Rivalries [ edit ]  Main article: Laver–Rosewall rivalry  Laver had a long-running, friendly rivalry with Ken Rosewall between 1963, when he started out as a pro, and 1976, when both were semi-retired from the main tour. Including tournaments and one-night stands, they played over 130 matches, all of them as professionals, with some results from the barnstorming pro tours lost or badly recorded. Overall a match score of 79–63 in favour of Laver can be documented.  Main article: Laver-Gonzales rivalry  Against the older Pancho Gonzales , whom he played 1964 to 1970 on the pro tour, Laver had a lead of 35–19 or 38–21, depending on the source.  Main article: Laver-Emerson rivalry  Laver had another, even longer rivalry with his fellow Queenslander Roy Emerson. They met first on the senior amateur tour in 1958 and dominated the amateur circuit until 1962, before Laver turned pro. When open tennis arrived in 1968, Emerson joined the pro tour, and had many new battles with Laver. Overall the score is 49–18 in favour of Laver, with 7–2 in major Grand Slam tournaments. Laver had also many battles with Lew Hoad in his first years on the pro circuit 1963–1966. Although he lost the first 8 matches in January 1963, Laver later in the year began to turn around their rivalry, and until 1966, he had built a 38–21 lead. Against Arthur Ashe , Laver had a head-to-head lead of 21–3, winning all of the first 18 matches. Ashe\\'s first win came in 1974, when Laver was 35. Another younger rival in the Open Era was John Newcombe, whom Laver led 16–5 in their head-to-head score.  Davis Cup [ edit ]  Laver helped Australia win the Davis Cup four consecutive times from 1959 to 1962. In 1973, professionals were permitted to play in the Davis Cup for the first time, and Laver was on a winning team for the fifth time, claiming two singles and a doubles rubber in the final as Australia beat the United States 5–0. Australia were crowned Davis Cup champions in each of the five seasons Laver played in the competition. Laver won 16 out of 20 Davis Cup singles matches and all four of his doubles.

Dan Maskell , the Voice of Wimbledon , described him as \"technically faultless.\" [28] His left-handed serve was well disguised and wide swinging. His groundstrokes on both flanks were hit with topspin, as was the attacking topspin lob, which Laver developed into a weapon. His stroke technique was based on quick shoulder turns, true swings, and accurate timing. His backhand, often hit on the run, was a point-ender that gave him an advantage. Laver was very quick and had a strong left forearm. Rex Bellamy wrote, \"The strength of that wrist and forearm gave him blazing power without loss of control, even when he was on the run and at full stretch. The combination of speed and strength, especially wrist strength, enabled him to hit ferocious winners when way out of court.\"  At the net, he had forcing volleys, often hit as stroke volleys. Especially on the backhand, he could hit sharp underspin angles as well.  He was difficult to lob, because of his springing agility, and when forced to retreat, he could come up with a vicious counterpunch. As an amateur, Laver was a somewhat flashy player, often a late starter. He had to learn to control his adventurous shot-making and integrate percentage tennis into his game when he turned professional. In his prime, he could adapt his style to all surfaces and to all conditions. Laver had a strong record in five-set-matches, often turning things around with subtle changes of tactics.  Legacy and place among the all-time great tennis players [ edit ]  Laver is widely regarded as one of the greatest tennis players in the history of the sport. [b] The members of the press, notably Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph , issued rankings for amateur players before the start of the Open Era and for all players after the start of that era. Laver was ranked by the press as the world No. 1 player in 1961 and 1962 (as an amateur) and in 1968 and 1969 (as a professional). According to the article, Bill Tilden was the best player for seven years and Pancho Gonzales for eight years. While Laver was indisputably the best player from 1965 through 1969, the article asserts that Laver had a valid claim for the top spot also for 1964 and 1970. Jack Kramer , the long-time tennis promoter, ranked Laver only in the \"second echelon\" of great players, just behind the six best. [38] He writes that although Laver was \"absolutely unbeatable for a year or two late in the 1960s\", a \"careful comparison\" could be made between Laver and the somewhat older Gonzales and that Kramer is \"positive that Gonzales could have beaten Laver regularly.\" Kramer\\'s main argument for downgrading Laver is that, \" Ken Rosewall beat Laver in those two World Championship of Tennis finals and that was a title Laver really wanted.\" Kramer sees as evidence of Gonzales\\' superiority over Laver the fact that Gonzales defeated Laver in a US$10,000 winner-take-all, five-set match before 15,000 spectators in New York City\\'s Madison Square Garden in January 1970, when Gonzales was 41 years old and Laver was still considered the World No. 1 player. On the other hand, Gonzales was still a top ten player when this match took place and Laver subsequently won this event, beating Gonzales in a straight-sets semifinal. Overall, his head-to-head-record with Gonzales was either 35–19 or 38–21 in favour of Laver, depending on the source. Laver was 12–5 against Gonzales during the Open Era, although Gonzales was then in his late thirties. [39]  Many experts disagree with Kramer\\'s assessment of Laver. For example, Dan Maskell , John Barrett , Joe McCauley, [40]  Ted Schroeder , and Tony Trabert rank Laver as the best of all time. Schroeder has been quoted by Alan Trengove as saying, \"You take all the criteria – longevity, playing on grass and clay, amateur, professional, his behaviour, his appearance – in all criteria, Laver\\'s the best player of all time.\" Trabert said in January 2008, \"I still maintain that Rod Laver is the best player who ever played the game because he\\'s done something no one has ever done in the 120 or 140-year history of our sport: he won the Grand Slam as an amateur and he won the Grand Slam as a pro. If someone in some other sport held a world record no one else had, you would say that person was the best in that sport. So in my view, you\\'ve got to say Laver is the best player of all time.\" [34] Similarly, the tennis author Peter Bodo wrote in May 2008, \"Give him credit? Shoot, the only real issue is whether the GOAT [Greatest of All Time] argument is a debate at all, given that posting those two Slams puts Laver in a league of his own.\" [41] Other experts cite the fact that during his amateur, touring professional, and Open Era careers, Laver won a record 184 singles titles. He also holds the record for most titles won in a single year during the amateur era (22 in 1962), [42] during the touring pro era (19 in 1967), [43] and during the Open Era (18 in 1969). [44] After turning professional in 1963, Laver won the U.S. Pro Tennis Championships five times and the Wembley Pro Championship four times from 1964 to 1967. In 1967, Laver won a \"Professional Grand Slam\" by winning all four of the major professional tournaments: the US Pro Championships, the Wembley Pro Championships, the French Pro Championship , and the Wimbledon Pro .   Sculpture depicting Rod Laver outside the Rod Laver Arena , Melbourne.  Laver came out on top in various experts polls for the best of all time. In 1986, the US magazine Inside Tennis polled 37 experts, which resulted in a computerised tournament. Laver ranked first on this list ahead of John McEnroe , Don Budge , Kramer, Björn Borg , Gonzales, Tilden, Jimmy Connors , Fred Perry , and Lew Hoad . In a poll by the Associated Press in 2000, Laver was voted \"The Male Tennis Player of the Century\", ahead of Pete Sampras , Tilden, Borg, Budge, McEnroe and Hoad (tied), Rosewall and Roy Emerson (tied), and Kramer. In an article in Tennis Week in 2007, the tennis historian Raymond Lee statistically analysed the all-time best players. Laver topped his list ahead of Tilden and Borg (tied), Roger Federer , Gonzales, Rosewall, Budge, Ivan Lendl , Connors, Sampras, McEnroe, and Kramer. In 2009 it was written that Rod Laver \"is considered by most folks who saw him play and many who\\'ve heard of his accomplishments, to be as great a tennis player that ever lived—current players included.\". In July 2017, tennis player Roger Federer called Rod Laver the greatest of all-time. [45]  In 1989, Bud Collins wrote, \"I remain unconvinced that there ever was a better player than Rod Laver\". [46] Thirteen years later, however, as editor of the \"Total Tennis, The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia\", Collins was more guarded. He wrote that Laver would \"be known as possibly the greatest player ever.\" but also said that Gonzales was \"probably as good as anyone who ever played the game, if not better.\"  And Collins called Tilden \"perhaps the greatest player of them all.\" [47] In an August 2006 article for MSNBC , Collins ranked Laver as one of the five top men\\'s tennis stars of all time, along with Tilden, Gonzales, Borg, and Sampras. He pointed to Tilden\\'s \"phenomenal .938 winning percentage\", said \"If I had to choose someone to play for my life it would be Pancho Gonzalez\", praised Borg\\'s uncanny transition from the French Open to Wimbledon, cited Sampras\\'s \"assault on the citadels of the past\", and called Laver \"in my eyes, the greatest player ever\". [48]  In 1973, the ATP\\'s computer rankings were established. Laver attained his highest ranking on that computer of World No. 3 in 1974. Laver\\'s highest year-end ranking by the ATP was World No. 4 in 1974. Laver semi-retired from the main professional tennis tour in 1975 while still being ranked in the top 10. In terms of yearly prize money won, Laver was the leader from 1964 until 1971. [49] The number of tournament singles titles that Laver won during his career varies depending on the source. The ATP credits Laver with 46 Open Era titles while \"Total Tennis: The Ultimate Tennis Encyclopedia\" (edited by Bud Collins), give him 47 or 54 titles during the Open Era alone. Collins credits him with 184 titles in amateur, professional, and open competition, without listing them in detail. Laver\\'s eleven Grand Slam singles titles currently place him tied with Borg for sixth place on the all-time list. Only Federer, Nadal, Sampras, Djokovic and Emerson have won more Grand Slam singles titles. Laver also won eight Major doubles titles. Laver is the only player to have twice won all four Grand Slam singles tournaments during the same calendar year although three of the four Grand Slams were played on grass at the time – the Australian Open, US Open, and Wimbledon. [50] Because none of the Majors were played on hardcourts in Laver\\'s era, he never won a Grand Slam tournament on that surface. The tennis landscape today is different as half of the year\\'s Majors are played on hardcourts. Only six players have won Major titles on clay, grass and hardcourts: Jimmy Connors , Mats Wilander , Andre Agassi , Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic . Federer, Nadal and Djokovic are the only players in history to have simultaneously held Grand Slam tournament titles on the three surfaces. [ citation needed ]  Previous observations change substantially if we also consider professional grand slam majors , which were played on three different surfaces (clay, grass and wood/parquet), and wherein Laver, like Rosewall, excelled. Furthermore, the ATP Performance Zone website lists his (partial) career win/loss percentage on hardcourt as .813, on carpet as .766, on grass as .827 and on clay as .764. [51] [52] [53] [54]  Laver was unable to compete in the Grand Slam tournaments during his professional career between 1963 and 1968 and it is argued he would likely have won more titles had he been able to do so. [4] Sports columnist Malcolm Knox of the Sydney Morning Herald assesses the effect of Laver\\'s ban on competing in Grand Slams. He states: \"..if grand slams are taken as the benchmark, consider this. Laver won 11 of the 16 grand slam titles he contested in his prime. The pro tour put him out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28\". Based on this he puts Laver and Rosewall in \"a class of two\". [55]   Honours [ edit ]  In 1969, Laver was awarded the ABC Sportsman of the Year Award . [56] Laver was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1981. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985 and upgraded to a Legend of Australian Sport in 2002. [57] He is also an Australian Living Treasure . In 2000, Centre Court at the National Tennis Centre in Melbourne was renamed Rod Laver Arena .  In 2009 Laver was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame. [58] A footbridge in Brisbane , connecting the Yeerongpilly rail station to the Queensland Tennis Centre, was named after him. [59]  In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Rod Laver was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a \"sports legends\".

[63]   Post-retirement [ edit ]  On 27 July 1998, Laver suffered a stroke while being interviewed by ESPN -TV in the United States for their SportsCentury 20th Century sports retrospective series. [64] He made a good recovery with excellent medical care. In 2000, the centre court at Melbourne Park , which today hosts the Australian Open, was named the Rod Laver Arena in his honour. In 2003, Laver, along with his fellow Australian tennis superstar Margaret Court , was honoured with his portrait on a postage stamp by the \"Australia Post Australian Legends Award\". Laver returned to his native country to present Roger Federer in 2006 and 2017, Rafael Nadal in 2009, and Novak Djokovic in 2012, the Norman Brookes Challenge Cup, which is awarded to the Men\\'s Singles winner of the Australian Open. He was present at Wimbledon to witness Federer make tennis history, when he surpassed Pete Sampras\\' record by winning his 15th Grand Slam Title. Laver resides in Carlsbad, California , [65] and attended San Diego Chargers games on occasion. [66]  After the short-lived reintroduction of knighthoods in Australia in 2014, there were calls for Laver to be knighted within the Order of Australia . [ citation needed ] In 2016 Laver was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia , [63] by which time knighthoods had again been abolished and the Companion was the highest honour available in the Order.\\nOn October 1, 2017 Laver was inducted into the Southern California Tennis Hall of Fame.

Venus Ebony Starr Williams [2] (born June 17, 1980) [3] is an American professional tennis player. A former world No. 1 , Williams is generally credited with ushering in a new era of power on the women\\'s professional tennis tour. [4] [5] [6]  Williams has been ranked world No. 1 by the Women\\'s Tennis Association on three occasions, for a total of 11 weeks. [7] She first reached the No. 1 ranking on February 25, 2002, the first African American woman to do so in the Open Era , and the second all time since Althea Gibson . Williams\\' seven Grand Slam singles titles are tied for 12th on the all-time list, [8] and 8th on the Open Era list, more than any other active female player except her sister. She has reached 16 Grand Slam finals, most recently at Wimbledon in 2017. She has also won 14 Grand Slam Women\\'s doubles titles, all with Serena Williams; the pair is unbeaten in Grand Slam doubles finals. [19] Williams also has two Mixed Doubles titles. Her five Wimbledon singles titles tie her with two other women for eighth place on the all-time list, but gives her sole possession of No. 4 on the Open Era List, trailing only the nine titles of Martina Navratilova and the seven of Serena Williams and Steffi Graf . From the 2000 Wimbledon Championships to the 2001 US Open , Williams won four of the six Grand Slam singles tournaments in that span. At the 2019 US Open , Williams extended her record as the all-time leader, male or female, in Grand Slams played, with 84. [9] With her run to the 2017 Wimbledon singles final, she broke the record for longest time between first and most recent grand slam singles finals appearances. Williams was twice the season prize money leader in 2001 and 2017. Williams has won four Olympic gold medals , one in singles and three in women\\'s doubles, along with a silver medal in mixed doubles, [10] pulling even with Kathleen McKane Godfree for the most Olympic medals won by a male or female tennis player. She is the only tennis player to have won a medal at four Olympic Games. At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Williams became only the second player to win Olympic gold medals in both singles and doubles at one Olympic Games, after Helen Wills Moody at the 1924 Summer Olympics . With 49 singles titles, Williams trails only her sister Serena Williams among active players on the WTA Tour with most singles titles. Her 35-match winning streak from the 2000 Wimbledon Championships to the 2000 Generali Ladies Linz tournament final is the longest since January 1, 2000. She is also one of only three active WTA players to have reached the finals of all four Grand Slams, along with Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova .

[12]  Her talents were apparent at the age of seven when a professional local tennis player named Tony Chesta spotted Williams and quickly identified her potential in the sport. [13]    Williams sisters at a Pam Shriver event in Baltimore, 1993  The Williams family moved from Compton, California , to West Palm Beach, Florida , when she was ten, so that she and her sister Serena could attend the tennis academy of Rick Macci , who took notice of the sisters and who would provide additional coaching. He did not always agree with Williams\\'s father but respected that \"he treated his daughters like kids, allowed them to be little girls\". [14] Richard stopped sending his daughters to national junior tennis tournaments when Williams was eleven, since he wanted them to take it slow and focus on schoolwork. Another motivation was racial, as he had allegedly heard parents of other players disparage the Williams sisters during tournaments. [15] At that time, Williams held a 63–0 record on the United States Tennis Association junior tour and was ranked No. 1\\xa0among the under-12 players in Southern California. [16] In 1995, Richard pulled his daughters out of Macci\\'s academy, and from then on took over all coaching at their home.

Her game is well adapted to grass, where she feels most comfortable, which is reflected in her five Wimbledon singles titles. She has developed into a skilful volleyer who uses her long arm span (1.85m) and agility around the net. [17] Williams also has great court coverage and can hit  winners from a defensive position. [18]  Williams holds the record for fastest serve in three of the four Grand Slam tournaments: 2007 French Open second round, 2008 Wimbledon final, 2007 U.S. Open first round – 129\\xa0mph (208\\xa0km/h).

[20] In the second round of her first professional tournament, the Bank of the West Classic in Oakland, Williams was up a set and a service break against world No. 2 Arantxa Sánchez Vicario before losing the match. That was the only tournament Williams played in 1994. In 1995, Williams played three more events as a wild card, falling in the first round of the tournament in Los Angeles and the tournament in Toronto but reaching the quarterfinals of the tournament in Oakland, defeating No. 18 Amy Frazier in the second round for her first win over a top 20 ranked player before losing to Magdalena Maleeva . Williams played five events in 1996, falling in the first round four times but reaching the third round in Los Angeles, before losing to No. 1 Steffi Graf .  1997–99: Early success [ edit ]  1997: Debut Grand Slam singles final [ edit ]  Williams played 15 tour events in 1997, including five Tier I tournaments. She reached the quarterfinals in three of the Tier I events – the State Farm Evert Cup in Indian Wells, California , the European Indoor Championships in Zürich, and the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. In Indian Wells in March, Williams defeated No. 9 Iva Majoli in the third round for her first win over a player ranked in the top 10. She then lost in the quarterfinals to No. 8 Lindsay Davenport in a third set tiebreak. Her ranking broke into the top 100 on April 14, 1997. She made her debut in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament at the French Open, reaching the second round before losing to Nathalie Tauziat . She then lost in the first round of Wimbledon to Magdalena Grzybowska . During her debut at the US Open , she lost the final to Martina Hingis after defeating Irina Spîrlea in a semifinal which saw Spîrlea and Williams collide during a changeover when neither would yield as they passed the umpire\\'s chair. Richard Williams , her father, later claimed that this incident was racially motivated. [21] She was the first woman since Pam Shriver in 1978 to reach a US Open singles final on her first attempt and was the first unseeded US Open women\\'s singles finalist since 1958. On September 8, 1997, her ranking broke into the top 50 for the first time. She ended the year ranked No. 22  1998: 1st WTA singles title and entering the top 10 [ edit ]  In her debut at the Australian Open , Williams defeated younger sister Serena Williams in the second round, which was the sisters\\' first professional meeting. Williams eventually lost in the quarterfinals to No. 3 Davenport. Three weeks later, Williams defeated No. 2 Davenport for the first time in the semifinals of the IGA Tennis Classic in Oklahoma City . Williams then defeated Joannette Kruger in the final to win the first singles title of her career. In her first Tier I event of the year, Williams lost in the semifinals of the State Farm Evert Cup in Indian Wells to No. 1 Hingis. The following week, Williams won the Tier I Lipton International Players Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida , defeating No. 1 Hingis in the semifinals. On March 30, 1998, her ranking broke into the top 10 for the first time, at No. 10. Williams played only one tournament on clay before the 1998 French Open .

She reached her fifth final of the year at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California , defeating No. 6 Monica Seles in the semifinals before losing to No. 1 Davenport. Patellar tendonitis in her left knee caused her to retire from her quarterfinal match at the tournament in San Diego while trailing Mary Pierce 4–0 in the third set. At the US Open , Williams defeated fourth-seeded Sánchez Vicario in the quarterfinals before losing to second seeded and eventual champion Davenport in the semifinals. 1998 was the first year that Williams reached at least the quarterfinals of all slams.

She finished the year ranked No. 5. In 1998, Williams teamed with Justin Gimelstob to win the mixed doubles titles at the Australian Open and the French Open. Her sister Serena Williams won the other two Grand Slam mixed doubles titles that year, completing a \"Williams Family Mixed Doubles Grand Slam\". Williams won the first two women\\'s doubles titles of her career, in Oklahoma City and Zürich. Both titles came with sister, becoming only the third pair of sisters to win a WTA tour doubles title. [22]   1999: Three Tier I titles and 1st Grand Slam doubles title [ edit ]  Williams started the 1999 tour in Australia, where she lost to No. 10 Steffi Graf in the quarterfinals of the Medibank International in Sydney and No. 1 Davenport in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open . However, she rebounded at the Faber Grand Prix in Hanover , defeating Graf for the first time in the semifinals before losing the final to No. 3 Novotná. Williams then successfully defended her titles in both Oklahoma City and Key Biscayne. She defeated Novotná and Graf to reach the final in Key Biscayne, where she defeated her sister in three sets in the first final on the WTA Tour to be contested by two sisters. Williams played four clay court events during the spring. She lost her first match at the Bausch & Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida .

At the 1999 Wimbledon Championships , Williams defeated No. 17 Anna Kournikova in the fourth round to reach the quarterfinals for the second consecutive year, where she lost to eventual runner-up Graf. Williams rebounded in the summer when she won two Fed Cup matches against Italy and lost in the final of the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford to No. 1 Davenport. One week later, Williams defeated Davenport in the semifinals of the TIG Tennis Classic in San Diego before losing to No. 2 Hingis in the final. In her last tournament before the US Open , Williams won the Pilot Pen Tennis in New Haven, Connecticut , defeating No. 5 Seles in the semifinals and Davenport in the final. On August 30, 1999, her world ranking reached third for the first time. Seeded third at the US Open , Williams lost in the semifinals to No. 1 Hingis in three sets. However, she teamed with singles champion Serena Williams at this event to win their second Grand Slam women\\'s doubles title. During the remainder of the year, Williams contributed to the USA\\'s victory over Russia in the Fed Cup final, winning one singles rubber before joining her sister to win the doubles rubber. At the Grand Slam Cup in Munich, Williams defeated Hingis in the semifinals before losing to her sister Serena for the first time in the final. Williams won her sixth title of the year at the Tier I event in Zurich, defeating No. 1 Hingis in the final. Four weeks later, she lost to Davenport in the semifinals of the tournament in Philadelphia . Making her debut at the year-ending Chase Championships, Williams lost to Hingis in the semifinals. She finished the year ranked No. 3.  2000–02: Williams sisters domination [ edit ]  2000: Olympic gold medals and 1st & 2nd Grand Slam titles [ edit ]  In 2000, Williams missed the first five months of the year with tendinitis in both wrists. She returned to the tour during the European clay court season. She lost in the quarterfinals of the Betty Barclay Cup in Hamburg to Amanda Coetzer and in the third round of the Tier I  Italian Open in Rome to Jelena Dokić . Although she had won only two of her four matches before the French Open , she was seeded fourth there.

At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney , she defeated Sánchez Vicario in the quarterfinals, Seles in the semifinals, and Elena Dementieva in the final to win the gold medal. She also won the gold medal in women\\'s doubles with her younger sister Serena. Davenport eventually snapped her winning streak in October in the final of the Linz Open . Williams did not play a tournament the rest of the year because of anemia . She finished the year ranked No. 3 and with six singles titles.  2001: 3rd & 4th Grand Slam titles [ edit ]   Williams in 2001  In 2001, Williams reached the semifinals of the Australian Open for the first time, where she lost to No. 1 Hingis. However, Williams teamed with her sister to win the doubles title at the event, completing a Career Golden Slam in women\\'s doubles for the pair. Williams also reached the semifinals of the Tier I Tennis Masters Series tournament in Indian Wells, California , where she controversially defaulted her match with her sister just before the match started. Williams had been suffering from knee tendinitis throughout the tournament and eventually this prevented her from playing. The following day, Williams and her father Richard were booed as they made their way to their seats to watch the final. [23] Serena Williams was subsequently booed during the final with Kim Clijsters and during the trophy presentation. Due to this, neither Williams sister entered the tournament for 14 years, [24] with her sister Serena entering in 2015 after appeals for forgiveness from the event and the WTA Tour. Williams rebounded from the Indian Wells \\'boycott\\' controversy to win the next tournament on the tour calendar, the Tier I Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida . She defeated Hingis in the semifinals and No. 4 Jennifer Capriati in the final, after saving eight championship points. Because of this victory, her ranking rose to a career high of No. 2. During the European clay court season, Williams won the Tier II tournament in Hamburg but lost in the third round of the Tier I EUROCARD Ladies German Open to No. 18 Justine Henin and the first round of the French Open to Barbara Schett . This was only the second time that she had lost in the first round of a Grand Slam singles tournament. Williams then successfully defended her Wimbledon title, defeating third-seeded Davenport in the semifinals and eighth-seeded Henin in three sets in Henin\\'s first Wimbledon final. During the North American summer hard court season, Williams won for the second consecutive year the tournaments in San Diego, defeating Seles in the final, and in New Haven, defeating Davenport in the final. Williams also won the US Open singles title for the second consecutive year, without dropping a set. In the quarterfinals, she beat fifth-seeded Clijsters, followed by a semifinal victory over No. 2 Capriati. She played her sister Serena in the final, which was the first Grand Slam singles final contested by two sisters during the open era. Venus won the match and her fourth Grand Slam singles title. Williams also became only the sixth woman in history to win the singles titles at both Wimbledon and the US Open in consecutive years, the others being Martina Navratilova (twice), Steffi Graf (twice), Althea Gibson , Maureen Connolly Brinker , and Helen Wills Moody (twice).  2002: World No. 1 ranking and 4 consecutive Grand Slam singles finals [ edit ]  Williams began 2002 by winning the Mondial Australian Women\\'s Hardcourts in Gold Coast, Australia , defeating Henin in the final. However, she then lost for the first time in her career to Seles in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open . Williams then went on to win the Open Gaz de France in Paris when Jelena Dokić withdrew from the final, and the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Belgium , defeating Henin in the final. As a result of her strong start to the season, Williams assumed the world No. 1 position for the first time on February 25, dislodging Capriati. Williams was the first African-American woman ever to hold the ranking. She held it for just three weeks before surrendering it back to Capriati. Williams failed to defend her title in Miami after losing in the semifinals to her sister Serena. However, she made a strong start to the clay-court season, winning the Bausch & Lomb Championships in Amelia Island, Florida , defeating Henin in the final. A week after winning that tournament, she once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1, before losing it again to Capriati after three weeks. During those three weeks, Williams had made the final in Hamburg, defeating Hingis in the semifinals before losing to Clijsters in the final. Seeded second at the French Open , Williams defeated former champion Seles to reach the semifinals for the first time. There, she defeated Clarisa Fernández . In the final, Williams met her sister Serena Williams for a second time in a Grand Slam final, with her sister winning. Williams once again replaced Capriati as the No. 1 as a result of reaching the final. As the top seed at Wimbledon , Williams defeated Henin in the semifinals to make the final for the third consecutive year. However, there, she lost to her sister Serena. This result meant Serena Williams replaced Venus as the No. 1. The Williams sisters teamed up to win the women\\'s doubles title at the event, their fifth Grand Slam women\\'s doubles title together. Williams won the titles in San Diego and New Haven for the third consecutive year, defeating Davenport and Dokic to win the former and defeating Davenport in the final of the latter. At the US Open , Williams defeated Seles in the quarterfinals and Amélie Mauresmo in three sets to make the final. Playing her younger sister Serena for their third consecutive Grand Slam final, her sister won once again. After that, Williams played just four more matches during the season. She reached the semifinals at the year-ending Sanex Championships after defeating Seles in the quarterfinals, but she then was forced to retire against Clijsters due to injury. Williams finished the year ranked No. 2 having won seven titles, her best showing in both respects of her career.  2003–06: Injuries and losses [ edit ]  2003: Australian Open final and injuries [ edit ]  Williams started 2003 by defeating fifth seed Justine Henin to make the final of the Australian Open for the first time. In the final, however, she lost to her sister Serena. This marked the first time in the open era that the same two players had met in four consecutive Grand Slam finals. Venus and Serena Williams teamed to win the women\\'s doubles title at the event, their sixth Grand Slam title in women\\'s doubles. In February, Williams won the Proximus Diamond Games in Antwerp, Belgium for the second consecutive year, defeating Kim Clijsters in the final. However, shortly afterwards, she began to struggle with injury. She reached the final of the clay-court J&S Cup in Warsaw, before being forced to retire against Amélie Mauresmo . She then suffered her earliest exit at a Grand Slam tournament in two years when she lost in the fourth round of the French Open to Vera Zvonareva . At Wimbledon , Williams was seeded fourth. Williams defeated former champion Lindsay Davenport in the quarterfinals and Kim Clijsters in the semifinals to advance to her fourth consecutive Wimbledon final, where she lost again to sister Serena. Wimbledon was Williams\\'s last event of the year as an abdominal injury that occurred during the Clijsters match prevented her from playing again. While she was recovering from the injury, her sister Yetunde Price was murdered. [25] Williams finished the year ranked No. 11. It was the first time in nearly six years that she had dropped out of the top 10.  2004: Tough losses and further injuries [ edit ]  In 2004, Williams came back to the tour suffering inconsistent results. As the third seed because of a protected ranking, she reached the third round of the Australian Open, where she lost to Lisa Raymond . She then lost in the quarterfinals of her next three tournaments. Williams began to find her form at the beginning of the clay-court season. At the Tier I  Family Circle Cup in Charleston, South Carolina , Williams defeated Conchita Martínez in the final to win her first title in over a year and the second Tier I title on clay of her career. She then won in Warsaw, defeating Svetlana Kuznetsova in the final, before reaching the final of the Tier I German Open in Berlin. She then withdrew from that match against Mauresmo due to injury. Going into the French Open , Williams had the best clay-court record among the women and was among the favorites to win the title; however, after making the quarterfinals to extend her winning streak on the surface to 19 matches, she lost to eventual champion Anastasia Myskina . Despite her defeat, she re-entered the top 10. In the Wimbledon Women\\'s Singles , Williams lost a controversial second-round match to Croatian Karolina Šprem . The umpire of the match, Ted Watts, awarded Šprem an unearned point in the second-set tiebreak. Upon the conclusion of the match, he was relieved of his duties. [26] This defeat marked the first time since 1997 that Williams had exited Wimbledon prior to the quarterfinals. After Wimbledon, Williams reached her fourth final of the year at the Bank of the West Classic in Stanford, California , where she was beaten by Lindsay Davenport for the first time since 2000. As the defending champion at the Athens Olympics , Williams lost in the third round to Mary Pierce . She then won three very close matches against Petra Mandula , Shikha Uberoi and Chanda Rubin to make the fourth round of the US Open where she lost to Davenport, the first time she had ever lost at the US Open prior to the semifinals. Williams completed the year by losing in the quarterfinals of three indoor tournaments in the fall, a period that included defeat in her first meeting with 17-year-old Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova at the Zurich Open . Williams finished the year as No. 9 and did not qualify for the year-ending WTA Tour Championships .  2005: Third Wimbledon title [ edit ]  In 2005, Williams started the year by losing in the fourth round of the Australian Open to Alicia Molik . She then reached the final in Antwerp, defeating Clijsters and Myskina en route. In the final, Williams was a set and a service break up against Mauresmo before eventually losing.

By reaching the final, her ranking improved to No. 4 and she crossed the $26\\xa0million mark in career prize money, the only player besides Serena Williams to do so. The knee injury that hampered her during the final of the Sony Ericsson Open forced her to skip the Fed Cup tie against Russia and the Porsche Tennis Grand Prix in Stuttgart. Williams returned to the tour at the Premier 5 Internazionali BNL d\\'Italia in Rome. She suffered the worst defeat of her career in the quarterfinals, losing to No. 4 Jelena Janković 6–0, 6–1.

Despite her knee injury, she made it to the quarterfinals, where she lost to Tsvetana Pironkova . Pironkova was ranked No. 82 and had never gone past the second round of a Grand Slam event.

Williams won the first set of their match and recovered from 5–2 down in the second set but ultimately double-faulted on a key point near the end of the match and lost in three sets. Because of Serena\\'s withdrawal from the US Open, Williams did not participate at the doubles event, where she was the defending champion. The recovery of her left knee took longer than expected and it forced her to miss the rest of 2010, including the year-ending Sony Ericsson Championships and Fed Cup final .

[35] This was also her first retirement from a match since LA Women\\'s Tennis Championships in Los Angeles in 2004, ending her 294 consecutive matches without retiring.

Overall, Venus has won 12 of those matches and Serena Williams has won 18. They have met in 15 Grand Slam tournaments, with Venus Williams winning five matches to her sister Serena\\'s ten. They have met in nine Grand Slam tournament finals, with Venus winning twice. Of the six occasions where they met in an earlier round, the victor has gone on to win the championship four times (Venus once, in the 2000 Wimbledon Championships ). Beginning with the 2002 French Open , they played each other in four consecutive Grand Slam singles finals, which was the first time in the open era that the same two players had contested four consecutive major finals.  Williams vs. Hingis [ edit ]  Williams and Hingis met 21 times during their careers. The overall head-to-head series is 11–10, in Hingis\\' favor. Their rivalry is one of the best in women\\'s sports and has been called a \"rivalry for the ages\". The pair met in the 1997 US Open final during Williams\\'s debut, Hingis won the match in straight sets.  Williams vs. Davenport [ edit ]  Davenport leads the rivalry 14–13 in their 27 professional matches. Williams leads 3–0 in Grand Slam Finals. The most noteworthy match they played was the 2005 Wimbledon championships which broke the record for the longest Wimbledon women\\'s final. Williams won the match and also saved a match point, which makes her only the second woman in the Open Era to save a match point and go on to win a Major final.  Fight for equal prize money [ edit ]  Despite years of protesting by tennis pioneer Billie Jean King and others, in 2005 the French Open and Wimbledon still refused to pay women\\'s and men\\'s players equally through all rounds. In 2005, Williams met with officials from both tournaments, arguing that female tennis players should be paid as much as male tennis players. [68] Although WTA tour President Larry Scott commented that she left \"a very meaningful impression\", Williams\\'s demands were rejected. The turning point was an essay published in The Times on the eve of Wimbledon in 2006. In it, Williams accused Wimbledon of being on the \"wrong side of history\", writing:  I feel so strongly that Wimbledon\\'s stance devalues the principle of meritocracy and diminishes the years of hard work that women on the tour have put into becoming professional tennis players. I believe that athletes – especially female athletes in the world\\'s leading sport for women – should serve as role models. The message I like to convey to women and girls across the globe is that there is no glass ceiling. My fear is that Wimbledon is loudly and clearly sending the opposite message.... Wimbledon has argued that women\\'s tennis is worth less for a variety of reasons; it says, for example, that because men play a best of five sets game they work harder for their prize money. This argument just doesn’t make sense; first of all, women players would be happy to play five sets matches in grand slam tournaments.... Secondly, tennis is unique in the world of professional sports. No other sport has men and women competing for a grand slam championship on the same stage, at the same time. So in the eyes of the general public the men\\'s and women\\'s games have the same value. Third,\\xa0... we enjoy huge and equal celebrity and are paid for the value we deliver to broadcasters and spectators, not the amount of time we spend on the stage. And, for the record, the ladies’ final at Wimbledon in 2005 lasted 45 minutes longer than the men\\'s.... Wimbledon has justified treating women as second class because we do more for the tournament. The argument goes that the top women – who are more likely also to play doubles matches than their male peers – earn more than the top men if you count singles, doubles and mixed doubles prize money. So the more we support the tournament, the more unequally we should be treated! But doubles and mixed doubles are separate events from the singles competition. Is Wimbledon suggesting that, if the top women withdrew from the doubles events, that then we would deserve equal prize money in singles? And how then does the All England Club explain why the pot of women\\'s doubles prize money is nearly £130,000 smaller than the men\\'s doubles prize money? I intend to keep doing everything I can until Billie Jean\\'s original dream of equality is made real. It\\'s a shame that the name of the greatest tournament in tennis, an event that should be a positive symbol for the sport, is tarnished. [68]   In response, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and members of Parliament publicly endorsed Williams\\'s arguments. [69] Later that year, the Women\\'s Tennis Association and UNESCO teamed for a campaign to promote gender equality in sports, asking Williams to lead the campaign. [70] Under enormous pressure, Wimbledon announced in February 2007 that it would award equal prize money to all competitors in all rounds, and the French Open followed suit a day later. [71] In the aftermath, the Chicago Sun-Times cited Williams as \"the single factor\" that \"changed the minds of the boys\" and a leader whose \"willingness to take a public stand separates her not only from most of her female peers, but also from our most celebrated male athletes.\" [72] Williams herself commented, \"Somewhere in the world a little girl is dreaming of holding a giant trophy in her hands and being viewed as an equal to boys who have similar dreams.\" [73]  Williams herself became the first woman to benefit from the equalization of prize money at Wimbledon, as she won the 2007 tournament and was awarded the same amount as the male winner Roger Federer . Williams\\'s fight for equality was documented in Nine for IX , Venus Vs. It premiered on July 2, 2013. [74] [75]   Other on court activities [ edit ]  1998: Karsten Braasch vs. the Williams sisters [ edit ]  Main article: Battle of the Sexes (tennis)  Williams competed in a \"Battle of the Sexes\", along with her sister Serena Williams , against Karsten Braasch at the 1998 Australian Open , who at the time was ranked 203rd. A decade and a half younger than Braasch, who was described by one journalist as \"a man whose training regime centered around a pack of cigarettes and more than a couple bottles of ice cold lager .\" [76] He nonetheless defeated both sisters, playing a single set against each, beating Serena Willams 6–1 and Venus Williams 6–2. [77] Braasch said afterwards, \"500 and above, no chance.\" He added that he had played like someone ranked 600th in order to keep the game \"fun.\" [78]   Personal life [ edit ]   Williams for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute\\'s \"National Wear Red Day\"  In 2003, at age 31, Yetunde Price , Venus and Serena Williams\\' older half-sister, was shot dead in Compton, California , near the courts on which the sisters once practiced. Price was the Williams sisters\\' personal assistant. The Williams family issued this statement shortly after the death: \"We are extremely shocked, saddened and devastated by the shooting death of our beloved Yetunde. She was our nucleus and our rock. She was a personal assistant, confidante, and adviser to her sisters, and her death leaves a void that can never be filled. Our grief is overwhelming, and this is the saddest day of our lives.\" [79]  On December 13, 2007, Williams received her associate degree in fashion design from the Art Institute of Fort Lauderdale . [80]  Williams\\' longtime boyfriend, pro golfer Hank Kuehne , was a visible presence from the time of Wimbledon 2007 until 2010, when Kuehne dated and (in May 2011) married his current wife, Andy. Williams is now dating millionaire heir Nicholas Hammond. [81]  In 2011, Williams was forced to withdraw from the US Open before her second-round match, following a Sjögren\\'s syndrome diagnosis. [39] After the diagnosis, she adopted a vegan diet, as well as reducing her intake of calories and sugars , which helped get her back to match winning fitness. [82]  In 2012, Venus Williams met Cuban Model Elio Pis when he was hired as an underwear model for her clothing line and started dating until 2015. [83]  In 2015, Williams received a Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Indiana University East . [84] Starting in 2011, she completed the degree through a reciprocal agreement between the university and the Women\\'s Tennis Association which allows athletes to play tennis professionally while studying online. Her ultimate goal is to get an MBA in the near future. [85]  Williams considers herself to be one of Jehovah\\'s Witnesses . [86]   2017 car accident [ edit ]  On June 9, 2017, Williams was driving in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, when another car collided with her SUV before she cleared the intersection, an accident that killed a 78-year-old man and injured another person in the second vehicle. Police originally said she was \"at fault\" for the accident, but after reviewing surveillance video, they determined on July 7 that she had not caused it. [87]  On December 21, 2017, authorities determined that the accident occurred after Williams’ vehicle was unlawfully cut off by an unidentified driver of a third vehicle, making a left turn in front of Williams. [88] A nearby surveillance camera had recorded Williams lawfully entering the intersection. Authorities determined the accident was caused by the unidentified third driver, not Williams. [89]   Entrepreneur [ edit ]  Williams is the chief executive officer of her interior design firm V Starr Interiors located in Jupiter, Florida . Her company designed the set of the Tavis Smiley Show on the Public Broadcasting Service , the Olympic athletes\\' apartments as part of New York City\\'s failed bid to host the 2012 Summer Olympics , and residences and businesses in the Palm Beach, Florida area. [90]  In 2001, Williams was named one of the 30 most powerful women in America by the Ladies Home Journal . [91]  In 2007, Williams teamed with retailer Steve & Barry\\'s to launch her own fashion line, EleVen. \"I love fashion and the idea that I am using my design education to actually create clothing and footwear that I will wear on and off the tennis court is a dream come true for me. The vision has been to create a collection that will allow women to enjoy an active lifestyle while remaining fashionable at the same time. I\\'m thrilled with everything we\\'ve created to launch EleVen.\" [92] [93] Williams\\' line, EleVen made its debut at the 2012 New York fashion week. It was modeled by athletes as opposed to models, a choice made by Williams herself to feature the sort of people the line was designed for. She flaunts her vibrant outfits each time she steps on the court. [94]  In June 2009, Williams was named 77th in the Top 100 Most Powerful Celebrities compiled by Forbes magazine. [95]  In August 2009, Venus Williams and her sister Serena Williams became part-owners of the Miami Dolphins . The announcement was made during a press conference overlooking the practice field. This made the sisters the first African-American women to obtain ownership in an NFL franchise. Stephen M. Ross , the majority owner of the Dolphins, said \"We are thrilled to have Venus and Serena Williams join the Dolphins as limited partners. They are among the most admired athletes in the world and have become global ambassadors for the game of tennis. Their addition to our ownership group further reflects our commitment to connect with aggressively and embrace the great diversity that makes South Florida a multicultural gem.\" [96]  In late June 2010, Williams released her first book, Come to Win; on How Sports Can Help You Top Your Profession , which she co-wrote with Kelly E. Carter. In promotion of the book she embarked on a tour around America in support of the release, whilst also appearing on several talk shows, including The Early Show and Good Morning America . This gave her a place in the Top 5 of The New York Times Best Seller List . [97]   Recognition [ edit ]  In 2005 Tennis Magazine ranked her as the 25th-best player in 40 years. [98] [99]  In June 2011, she was named one of the \"30 Legends of Women\\'s Tennis: Past, Present and Future\" by Time . [100]  In March 2012, Tennis Channel aired a television series \"100 greatest tennis players of all time\", where she was ranked as 22nd. During the programme Williams was complimented by rival Lindsay Davenport , with Davenport saying \\'Venus had more power than any other player on tour\\'.

Clijsters was a world No. 1 in both singles and doubles, having held both rankings simultaneously in 2003. She won a total of six Grand Slam tournament titles, four in singles and two in doubles. Clijsters competed professionally from 1997 to 2012 in an era in which her primary rivals were compatriot Justine Henin and 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams . Coming from a country with limited success in men\\'s or women\\'s tennis, Clijsters became the first Belgian player to attain the No. 1 ranking. Together with Henin, she established Belgium as a leading force in women\\'s tennis as the two of them led their country to their first Fed Cup crown in 2001 and were the top two players in the world in late 2003. Individually, Clijsters won 41 singles titles and 11 doubles titles on the Women\\'s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour. She was a three-time winner of the WTA Tour Championships . Between singles and doubles, she was a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the US Open and the Australian Open in singles and Wimbledon and the French Open in doubles with Ai Sugiyama . Her success at majors was highlighted by winning three consecutive appearances at the US Open. Plagued by injuries and having lost some of her desire to compete, Clijsters initially retired from tennis in 2007 at the age of 23 to get married and have a daughter. She returned to the sport two years later and won her second US Open title as an unranked player in just her third tournament back. She defended her title the following year and then won the Australian Open in 2011 en route to becoming the first mother to be ranked No. 1 by the WTA. Along with Margaret Court , she also holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a mother, with three such titles, and was the first to win one since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. After being retired from professional tennis for seven years since the 2012 US Open, Clijsters announced she is planning another comeback in 2020. Clijsters was born to athletic parents with backgrounds in professional football and gymnastics. She was renowned for her athleticism, which was highlighted by her ability to perform splits on court in the middle of points. She built the offensive side of her game around controlled aggression while also using her exceptional movement to become an elite defensive player. Clijsters was very popular and well-liked as a player, having won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award eight times. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.

She grew up with her younger sister Elke in the nearby town of Bree in the Flemish province of Limburg . [2] Kim is the daughter of Lei Clijsters and Els Vandecaetsbeek, both of whom were accomplished athletes. Her mother Els was a Belgian national artistic gymnastics champion. Her father Lei was a professional football  defender who played for a variety of clubs in the top-flight Belgian First Division , including KV Mechelen with whom he won the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1988. He was also a member of the Belgium national football team , tallying 40 caps and competing in two World Cups . [3] [4] Clijsters credits her parents for giving her a footballer\\'s legs and a gymnast\\'s flexibility. [1] She also attributes her success to the freedom they gave her when she was a young player, saying, \"Without the support I\\'ve had from my family, I wouldn\\'t be where I am. They\\'ve let me make my own decisions.\" [5]  When Clijsters was five years old, her father built a clay tennis court at their home as a gift to his daughter to celebrate him winning the 1988 Gouden Schoen , an award given to the player of the year in the Belgian First Division. He had previously announced the idea of the gift as a celebration of the award during a television interview. [3] [6] [7] Clijsters began playing tennis earlier that year after attending a lesson with her cousins and her uncle while her parents were away. [2] From then on, she became fixated on the sport. She began playing with her sister at the Tennisdel club in Genk by the time she was seven. Her first coach Bart Van Kerckhoven recalled that she was extremely energetic and never wanted to leave the tennis court, adding that, \"If the group before her did some sprints to finish off the session, Kim would join in. Then she put her heart and soul into her own training session, after which she joined the next group for their warm-up exercises.\" [6]  At the age of nine, Clijsters began working with Benny Vanhoudt in the more distant town of Diest . Along with her sister, she trained for fifteen hours a week, including five hours of individual instruction, which Vanhoudt said was \"an insane amount [of total hours].\" [8] She continued to train in Diest until she was twelve. During this time, she also first worked with Carl Maes and Wim Fissette , both of whom would coach Clijsters later in her professional career. When she was thirteen, Maes took over as her primary coach at the Flemish Tennis Association in Antwerp . [9]   Junior career [ edit ]  Clijsters had success at both the national and international levels at a very young age. In 1993, she won the 12-and-under division of the Belgian Junior Championships (the Coupe de Borman) in doubles with her future longtime rival Justine Henin . At the time, Clijsters was ten years old and Henin was eleven. [6] A year later, she won the 12-and-under singles event at the same tournament. [10] Clijsters continued to play alongside Henin, winning the doubles event at the 14-and-under European Junior Championships as well as the 14-and-under European Junior Team Championships for Belgium, both in 1996 and the latter of which also with Leslie Butkiewicz . [6] [11] Her first big international junior title came at Les Petits As , a high-level 14-and-under tournament. She defeated future top 25 players Iveta Benešová and Elena Bovina in the semifinals and final respectively. [6]  Clijsters played two full seasons on the ITF Junior Circuit , the premier junior tour that is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). At the very end of 1997, she partnered with Zsófia Gubacsi to win her first ITF title in the doubles event at the Grade A Orange Bowl , one of the highest level junior tournaments. [12] In 1998, Clijsters had her best year on the junior tour, finishing the season at career-high rankings of world No. 11 in singles and world No. 4 in doubles. [13] [14] She won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles, the French Open with Jelena Dokic and the US Open with Eva Dyrberg . [15] [16] She defeated her French Open partner Dokic in the US Open doubles final. [16] In singles, she made it to the Wimbledon final, but finished runner-up to Katarina Srebotnik . [9]   Professional career [ edit ]  1997–99: Maiden WTA title, Newcomer of the Year [ edit ]   Clijsters (right) with her idol Steffi Graf in 2009. Graf won their only meeting on the WTA Tour in 1999.  As a fourteen year old, Clijsters could only enter professional tournaments through qualifying since the WTA Tour\\'s policy did not allow players her age to receive main draw wild cards . In August 1997, Clijsters qualified for her first main draw at her second career tournament on the lower-level ITF Women\\'s Circuit , which was held in the Belgian coastal town of Koksijde . She won seven matches in total, including five in qualifying, to reach the quarterfinals. Clijsters did not enter another professional tournament until after her runner-up finish at the Wimbledon girls\\' singles event the following summer. Playing in Brussels in July 1998, she won both the singles and doubles events for her first career professional titles. Clijsters continued to excel at the ITF level, winning four more titles within the next year, two in both singles and doubles. [9] [17]  Clijsters began 1999 with a WTA singles ranking of No. 420 in the world. [18] Around this time, Belgian women\\'s tennis was beginning to flourish. Both Dominique Van Roost and Sabine Appelmans had been ranked in the top 20 within the previous two years, complementing the rise of Clijsters and Henin on the junior tour. This success helped lead to the revival of the only WTA tournament in Belgium, which was relaunched as the Flanders Women\\'s Open in Antwerp after not being held in six years. Clijsters made her WTA debut at the tournament in May, entering the main draw as a lucky loser after losing in the final round of qualifying. She won her first career tour-level match against Miho Saeki and advanced to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by top seed Sarah Pitkowski despite holding match points. [19]  One week after Clijsters turned sixteen, she entered Wimbledon as the youngest player in the top 200. After barely having a high enough ranking to get into the qualifying draw, she ultimately made it to the round of sixteen in her Grand Slam tournament debut. She defeated world No. 10 Amanda Coetzer in the third round and did not drop a set until losing to Steffi Graf one round later, her only career match against her childhood idol. [2] [20] [21] Clijsters also had a good showing at the US Open , losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams in the third round after squandering a chance to serve for the match. [21] Clijsters next played at the Luxembourg Open held in the town of Kockelscheuer just outside the capital. She won the title with relative ease in just her fourth career WTA event, taking affinity for the friendly atmosphere of the smaller tournament and the faster carpet courts. Most notably, she faced off against Van Roost in the final and only conceded four games to the top-ranked Belgian. [22] Clijsters also made the singles final in Bratislava at her next tournament, finishing runner-up to No. 11 Amélie Mauresmo . Nonetheless, she was able to win the doubles event with compatriot Laurence Courtois as her partner. [23] At the end of the season, Clijsters was named WTA Newcomer of the Year , having risen to No. 47 in the world. [24]   2000–02: French Open finalist, Tour champion [ edit ]  Clijsters was unable to repeat her success at the Grand Slam tournaments in 2000, not advancing past the second round at any of the singles events. [17] However, she continued her steady climb in the rankings up to No. 18 on the strength of two more titles, [18] one at the Tasmanian International in her first tournament of the year [25] and another at the Sparkassen Cup in Germany near the end of the season. [26] The latter victory was Clijsters\\'s first at a Tier II event (the second highest level tournament) and followed up a loss in another Tier II final to world No. 1 Martina Hingis earlier that month. [27] In the middle of the year, Clijsters also finished runner-up at the Wimbledon mixed doubles event alongside her boyfriend Lleyton Hewitt . [23]    The Kockelscheuer Sport Centre , where Clijsters won five Luxembourg Open titles, including three consecutive in 2001–03.  At the Indian Wells Open in early 2001, Clijsters finally defeated Hingis in her fourth meeting against the world No. 1 player to reach her first Tier I final. [28] After winning the first set of the final, she ended up losing in three sets to Serena Williams. The match was overshadowed by the controversy of the crowd booing Williams for her sister Venus \\'s late withdrawal from their semifinal, leading to both sisters boycotting the tournament for 14 years . [29] [30] A few months later at the French Open , Clijsters became the first Belgian to contest a Grand Slam singles final. She had defeated No. 16 Henin in the semifinals in their closest and highest profile match to date, coming back from a set and a break down, and also having saved three break points that would have put her behind 5–2 in the second set. [31] The final against Australian Open champion and world No. 4 Jennifer Capriati was an even tighter match. Playing a day after her 18th birthday, Clijsters won the first set but lost the second. After a French Open final record 22 games and 2 hours 21 minutes in total, she was defeated by Capriati 12–10 in the deciding set. [32] [33] The match was ranked as the greatest French Open women\\'s final in Open Era history by Tennis.com . [33] Clijsters would go on to make it to at least the quarterfinals at each of the next three majors. [17] She also played in her first Grand Slam doubles final at Wimbledon later that year, with Ai Sugiyama as her partner. [34] She won three singles titles in 2001, including her second titles at both the Luxembourg Open and the Sparkassen Cup , to help her finish the season at No. 5 in the world. With four doubles finals in total, she was also ranked No. 15 in doubles at the end of the year. [17] [18]  Clijsters maintained her top ten ranking throughout 2002 [18] despite struggling with an ongoing shoulder injury in the first half of the year. [35] Her best result at a Grand Slam event came at the Australian Open , where she lost another three-set match to Capriati in the semifinals in their first meeting since the French Open final. [36] Nonetheless, she continued to rise in the rankings to No. 3 by March, her best ranking for the season. [18] Although Clijsters did not reach another Grand Slam quarterfinal the rest of the year, she won three more titles leading up to the year-end WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles . [17] She received her third invite to the event, which only the top 16 players in the world are guaranteed entry. Clijsters made it to the final with ease after dropping only six games in the first three rounds, including a victory over Henin in the quarterfinals [37] and a retirement due to injury from Venus Williams in the semifinals. Her opponent in the final was Serena Williams, who entered the match with a 56–4 record on the season and having won the last three majors of the year. Although Serena had won their first five encounters and was considered a clear favourite, Clijsters upset Serena in straight sets to win the championship. [38] After the tournament, she said, \"This is the best victory of my career.\" [35]   2003: World No. 1 in singles and doubles [ edit ]  The 2003 season was Clijsters\\'s \" annus mirabilis \". [39] She competed in 21 singles events, reaching the semifinals in all but one of them, advancing to 15 finals, and winning nine titles. With a record of 90–12, she was the first player to accrue 90 wins since Martina Navratilova in 1982 and the first to play more than 100 matches since Chris Evert in 1974. [40] Clijsters also played an extensive doubles schedule, compiling a total of 170 matches between both disciplines. [39] She partnered with Sugiyama the entire year, winning seven titles in thirteen events. [17] This season also marked the peak of the rivalry between Clijsters and Henin , as the pair faced each other eight matches, the last six of which were in finals. [41] In doubles, five of her ten finals were against the team of Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez . [17] With her success, Clijsters became the first Belgian world No. 1 in singles or doubles, achieving both feats in August. [18]   Singles: Two Grand Slam finals, Tour Championship defense [ edit ]  Clijsters began her singles season by winning the Sydney International over Lindsay Davenport , her third consecutive title. [42] She extended her tour win streak to 17 matches—all without dropping a set [17] —before she was defeated by Serena Williams in an Australian Open semifinal where she had a 5–1 lead in the third set as well as two match points on serve. She said afterwards, \"The only thing I regret a little bit, is those two double faults [to start the game at 5–4]. I could feel that she was really trying to step it up, and that she was hitting the balls a lot more aggressive and had almost no unforced errors at the end.\" [43] [44] Williams won the title to complete her \"Serena Slam\". [45] After losing in the final at her next two tournaments, Clijsters recovered at the Indian Wells Open to win her first Tier I title. Like in Sydney, she defeated Davenport in the final. [46] She won another Tier I title on clay in May at the Italian Open over No. 4 Amélie Mauresmo, who had a chance to serve for the match in the second set. [47]  At the French Open , both Clijsters and Henin reached the final to guarantee that the winner would become the first Belgian Grand Slam singles champion. [39] Henin had won their only meeting in a final in 2003 thus far at the German Open , which was also their only other encounter on clay. [41] While both players had match points in Germany, [48] Henin won in Paris in a lopsided affair where she only lost four games. [49] After losing in the semifinals at Wimbledon to Venus Williams, [50] Clijsters rebounded to win two Tier II titles at the Stanford Classic [51] and the Los Angeles Open . With the second of those titles, she attained the world No. 1 ranking, in part because the top-ranked Serena Williams had not played on tour since Wimbledon due to a knee injury. [39] She was the first woman to become No. 1 without winning a Grand Slam singles title. [40] [52] Clijsters regained the top ranking in doubles the following week to become only the fifth player in WTA history to be No. 1 in singles and doubles simultaneously. [40] [53] Despite playing the US Open as the top seed, Clijsters again lost to Henin in the final in straight sets. Clijsters had been regarded as the favourite entering the match because of her performance in the earlier rounds and Henin\\'s lengthy semifinal match the previous day. [39] [54] The title helped Henin rise to No. 2 in the world. [55]  The last stage of the season featured Clijsters battling Henin for the top ranking. Clijsters defeated Henin in the final of the Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt to defend her title and her world No. 1 ranking. This was the eighth time in WTA history where the top two players in the world faced off for the top ranking. [56] Although Clijsters lost the top ranking to Henin the following week, [57] she regained it a week later by winning the Luxembourg Open for the third year in a row. [18] [58] She finished her season by defending her title at the WTA Tour Championships in the first year where the tournament switched to a round robin format in the initial stage. Clijsters swept her group of Mauresmo, Elena Dementieva , and Chanda Rubin . [59] She won her semifinal against Capriati before defeating Mauresmo again for the title. With the million dollar prize, Clijsters finished the season as the tour prize money leader and became the first player to earn four million dollars in a season on the WTA Tour. [60] Nonetheless, Henin took the year-end No. 1 ranking by improving on her performance at the event from the previous season. [61]   Doubles: French Open and Wimbledon titles [ edit ]   Ai Sugiyama , Clijsters\\'s doubles partner in 2003  In the early part of the season, Clijsters and Sugiyama won three titles on hard courts. [17] However, they did not win any big titles through May, losing in the Australian Open quarterfinals to the Williams sisters and finishing runners-up at their first two Tier I finals. [17] [62] They entered the French Open and Wimbledon and made it to the finals at both events. Clijsters and Sugiyama defeated the top seeds Ruano Pascual and Suarez in both finals for Clijsters\\'s first two Grand Slam tournament titles. The French Open final was a tighter match, ending 9–7 in the third set. [39] [63] Despite these titles, the duo remained behind Ruano Pascual and Suarez in the rankings until August when Clijsters became world No. 1. She held the top ranking for four non-consecutive weeks. [18] [64] The pair were the top seeds at the US Open, but withdrew in the second round due to rain delaying Sugiyama\\'s fourth round singles match for three days. [65] They ended the season by finishing runners-up to Ruano Pascual and Suarez at the WTA Tour Championships. [66] Despite Clijsters\\'s success in 2003, she seldom played doubles during the rest of her career. [67]   2004–05: Extended injury absence, first Grand Slam singles title [ edit ]  Although Clijsters maintained her form into 2004, her season was ultimately marred by injuries. It was feared that she would need surgery and miss the Australian Open after she injured her left ankle in the Hopman Cup . [68] Nonetheless, she competed at the event and reached the championship match without dropping a set, despite aggravating her ankle injury in the quarterfinals. [69] Her opponent in the final was Henin and unlike their previous two Grand Slam finals, Clijsters was able to win a set. With Henin up a break at 4–3 in the third set, the chair umpire incorrectly overruled a line call on break point that would have leveled the match. Henin ended up winning the game and the match. Clijsters said afterwards, \"I\\'m just as disappointed as after the last two grand slam [finals], but I played a lot better this time\". [70] In February, she won her next two tournaments, including the Diamond Games in Antwerp for her first WTA title in her home country. [71] After Clijsters withdrew from the Indian Wells Open following one match with a torn left wrist tendon, she only played in two more WTA events the remainder of the season. She returned to the WTA Tour six weeks later with a wrist brace, but again withdrew after one match. In June, she found out she would need surgery to remove a cyst in her wrist. [72] [73] As a result, she remained out until the Hasselt Cup in Belgium where she needed to retire in her third match. [72] [74]  There were few expectations on Clijsters entering 2005, as it still was not certain whether she would be able to play. [75] After missing the Australian Open, she returned to the tour in February. In her second and third tournaments back, Clijsters won both Tier I events in March, the Indian Wells Open and the Miami Open , to become the second woman to complete the Sunshine Double after Steffi Graf in 1994 and 1996. [76] [77] She defeated world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the final of Indian Wells, as well as No. 2 Amélie Mauresmo and No. 3 Maria Sharapova in her last two matches in Miami. [78] These titles lifted her ranking from outside the top 100 back into the top 20. [18] [75] Clijsters was unable to continue her success into the clay or grass court seasons, winning just one title and losing in the fourth round in three sets to Davenport at both the French Open and Wimbledon . [17] [79]    \"It\\'s very hard to believe and an amazing feeling to have. After being out for so much of last year it\\'s a little bit more special.\"  — Clijsters on winning the 2005 US Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. [80]    After Wimbledon in late June, [81] Clijsters only lost one more match through early October. [17] During this stretch, she won five titles including her third Stanford Classic [82] and her fifth Luxembourg Open . [83] She also built up a 22-match win streak [83] and defeated Henin in the final of the Tier I Canadian Open in their only meeting of the year. [41] [84] Clijsters\\'s most important title of the season was the US Open , her first Grand Slam singles title. As the fourth seed, she was not tested until the quarterfinals, when Venus Williams was two games away from defeating her at a set and a break up. Clijsters rebounded to win the match in three sets and then defeated the top seed and world No. 2 Sharapova in the semifinals, also in three sets. Despite her previous struggles in Grand Slam singles finals, she won the championship against No. 13 Mary Pierce with ease, only conceding four games. [79] As the winner of the US Open Series , Clijsters received double the standard amount of prize money. Her $2.2 million prize was the largest in women\\'s sports history at the time. [85] Clijsters\\'s last tournament of the year was the WTA Tour Championships . Although she had a chance to return to No. 1 if she outperformed the top-ranked Davenport, she only won one match and did not advance out of her round robin group. [86] She finished the year ranked No. 2, having won a tour-best nine titles and all of her finals. [17] [18] [86] She was named both the WTA Player of the Year and the WTA Comeback Player of the Year . [87] Despite this success, Clijsters announced in August that she was planning to retire in 2007 because of her injury troubles. [88]   2006–07: Return to No. 1, hastened retirement [ edit ]   Clijsters in 2006  The 2006 season saw a variety of injury issues for Clijsters. She only played in 14 tournaments, missing the US Open as well as the Fed Cup final. While she reached the semifinals at the other three Grand Slam singles events, she was unable to advance to another final. [17] Clijsters withdrew from her first tournament of the year, the Sydney International with hip and back problems. [89] Although she recovered from those issues in time to reach the semifinals at the Australian Open , she needed to retire from that match as well after twisting her ankle while down a break in the third set against Amélie Mauresmo. [90] Nonetheless, with Davenport losing in the quarterfinals, Clijsters regained the No. 1 ranking. [91] She held the top ranking through mid-March. [18] Clijsters returned for the Diamond Games where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo, [92] but needed to withdraw from the Indian Wells Open because of the same ankle injury. [93] While she was healthy enough to play a regular schedule during the clay and grass court seasons, Henin continued her recent dominance of their rivalry over this stretch. She defeated Clijsters in the semifinals of three consecutive events, including the French Open and Wimbledon . [17] [94] [95]  During the US Open Series, Clijsters won her fourth Stanford Classic [96] and finished runner-up to Maria Sharapova at the Tier I San Diego Classic . [97] However, her summer season came to an end when she fell on her left wrist in her opening round match at the Canadian Open . [98] This injury kept her out until late October. She made her return at the Hasselt Cup and won her second consecutive title at the event. [99] Clijsters entered the WTA Tour Championships ranked No. 5 in the world, [18] where all three other players she was grouped with were Russian. [100] Although she lost to her group\\'s top seed, Sharapova, she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Dementieva to advance. Her season ended in the semifinals, where she lost to world No. 1 Mauresmo. [101]  Clijsters entered 2007 intending to retire at the end of the season, [102] but only ended up playing in five tournaments due to injuries. [103] She won her only title of the year in her first tournament, the Sydney International . The Australian Open was her only Grand Slam event of the season. For the second consecutive season, she lost in the semifinals, this time to top seed Sharapova. Clijsters\\'s last tournament in Belgium was the Diamond Games , where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo for the second year in a row. [103] A hip injury limited Clijsters\\'s remaining schedule. [104] In her last two tournaments, she lost to Li Na in the fourth round of the Miami Open in March [105] and qualifier Julia Vakulenko in her opening match at the Warsaw Open in May. [106] Her last win was against Samantha Stosur in Miami. [17] A few days after losing in Warsaw, Clijsters announced her retirement at the age of 23, forgoing plans to finish the season. [107]   Two-year hiatus [ edit ]  A few months after Clijsters retired, she married basketball player Brian Lynch . She gave birth to a daughter in early 2008, less than two months after her father Leo Clijsters was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died twelve months later in January 2009. Clijsters said, \"The birth of Jada was the best moment of my life, but it also taught me a lesson because we knew that my Dad was terminally ill. I realised that new life had been born, but a few months later another life would disappear. It was a very intense period in our lives.\" [108]  Nearly two months after her father\\'s death, it was announced that Clijsters would play in an exhibition in May with Tim Henman against Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi to test the new retractable roof on Centre Court at Wimbledon. [109] In March, Clijsters stated that she was planning to come out of retirement, motivated by returning to the \"training schedule from [her] pro days\" to prepare for the Wimbledon exhibition. She added that she was taking a different approach to tennis, saying, \"I am looking at this as a second career, not as a comeback as I am now in a situation where not everything revolves around tennis 24 hours a day.\" [110] Clijsters and Henman won the exhibition doubles, and Clijsters also defeated her idol Graf in singles. She commented, \"I wanted to feel good here on court. And I\\'ve enjoyed it. This is the pleasure which was lacking at the end of my first career. But now I\\'ve got my motivation back.\" [111]   2009–10: Start of second career, back-to-back US Open titles [ edit ]   Clijsters at the 2010 US Open  With no ranking, Clijsters needed wild cards to begin her comeback. She requested and received wild cards for the Cincinnati Open , the Canadian Open , and the US Open . [110] [112] In her return to the tour in Cincinnati, Clijsters defeated three top 20 opponents, including No. 6 Svetlana Kuznetsova, [113] before losing to world No. 1 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals. [78] [114] She recorded another top ten victory in Canada over No. 9 Victoria Azarenka . [78] Clijsters was still unranked entering the US Open, as players needed three tour events to have a ranking at the time. [115] Nonetheless, she made it to the final, notably upsetting both Williams sisters, No. 3 Venus in the fourth round and No. 2 Serena in the semifinals. She defeated Venus in a tight third set after they split the first two 6–0. [116] Her straight sets win over Serena was overshadowed by her opponent receiving a point penalty on match point for verbally abusing a line judge. [117] Clijsters then defeated No. 8 Caroline Wozniacki to win her second US Open championship. She became the first unseeded woman to win the title at the event, and the first mother to win a Grand Slam singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. [118] [119] [120] With the title, she entered the WTA rankings at No. 19. [115] Her only other tournament of the year was the Luxembourg Open , where she lost her second match. [121] At the end of the season, she won the WTA Comeback Player of the Year award for the second time. [87]  Clijsters planned a limited schedule for 2010 to keep her focus on her family and ended up playing just eleven tournaments. [122] In her first event of the year, she won the Brisbane International , narrowly defeating Henin in a third set tiebreak in Henin\\'s first tournament back from her own retirement. [123] She entered the Australian Open as one of the favourites, but was upset by No. 19 Nadia Petrova in the third round, only winning one game in that loss. [124] Clijsters did not return to the tour until March. After an early loss at the Indian Wells Open , she won the Miami Open for the second time. The only set she lost was in the semifinals to Henin, who she again defeated in a third set tiebreak. [78] [125] She only conceded three games in the final against Venus Williams. [126] During the clay court season, Clijsters tore a muscle in her left foot, which kept her out of the French Open. [127] [128] Although she returned for Wimbledon , she was upset in the quarterfinals by Vera Zvonareva after recording another win over Henin in the previous round. [129] [130]    \"That defeat against Zvonareva at Wimbledon was hard to take. It had been perhaps my best and last chance to reach the final. In the semifinal of the US Open, I was absolutely bent on gaining revenge. And I succeeded, too... I\\'d become the player I\\'d always wanted to be.\"  — Clijsters on the 2010 US Open final. [131]    In the latter half of the year, Clijsters entered only four tournaments. During the US Open Series, she won the Cincinnati Open , the tournament where she returned from retirement a year earlier. [132] At her next event, she was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open by Zvonareva while struggling with a thigh injury. [133] Nonetheless, Clijsters recovered to defend her title at the US Open . In the last three rounds, she defeated three top ten players in No. 6 Samantha Stosur, No. 4 Venus Williams, and No. 8 Vera Zvonareva. [78] Venus came the closest to ending her title defense, but lost in three sets after serving two double faults in the second set tiebreak which could have won her the match. [134] Clijsters won the final over Zvonareva with ease in less than an hour. This was her third consecutive title at the US Open and the fourth consecutive time she made it to the championship match, having skipped the tournament four times since 2003. [131] Clijsters\\' final event of the season was the WTA Tour Championships , where she qualified for the seventh time. Despite a loss to Zvonareva in her last round robin match, she advanced to the knockout rounds and defeated No. 5 Stosur and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki for her third title at the year-end championships. [135] Clijsters finished the season at No. 3 and was named WTA Player of the Year for the second time. [18] [136]   2011–12: Australian Open champion, last reign at No. 1 [ edit ]  By the start of 2011, Clijsters knew she was planning to retire in 2012 as she did not want to be on the tour while her daughter was in school. [137] She began the season at the Sydney International , where she finished runner-up to Li Na in straight sets despite winning the first five games of the match. [138] The two also met in the final of their next tournament, the Australian Open . Although Clijsters again lost the first set, she recovered to win the championship, her fourth Grand Slam singles title and first outside of the US Open. [137] [139] This title would be the last of Clijsters\\'s career. [17] She made one last final at her next WTA event, the Paris Open , where she was defeated by Petra Kvitová . Nonetheless, this result helped Clijsters regain the world No. 1 ranking before Caroline Wozniacki took it back one week later. [140] [141] During the rest of the season, Clijsters was limited by a variety of injuries and only played five more tournaments. [78] She needed to retire from a fourth round match at the Indian Wells Open due to a shoulder injury. [142] Then, as a result of a right ankle injury suffered while dancing at a wedding in April, the French Open was the only clay court event she entered. At the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, she was upset in the second round by No. 114 Arantxa Rus after failing to convert two match points in the second set. [143] Aggravating that ankle injury at her next event then forced her to miss Wimbledon. [144] Clijsters returned for the Canadian Open , where she suffered an abdominal injury that kept her out the remainder of the season. [142] [145]    Clijsters after her last WTA singles match win against Victoria Duval  Clijsters was unable to stay healthy in her last year on the WTA Tour. In the first week of the season, she returned to the tour for the Brisbane International . After winning her first three matches back, she needed to retire in the semifinals due to hip spasms, a precautionary measure to prepare for the Australian Open. [146] As the defending champion at the year\\'s first Grand Slam event, Clijsters made it to the semifinals. Her fourth round victory came against No. 5 Li Na in a rematch of the 2011 final. She overcame rolling her ankle in the first set and saved four match points at 6–2 in the second set tiebreak to win in three sets. [147] After Clijsters defeated world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals, [148] she lost to No. 3 Victoria Azarenka in another three set match. [149] [150] Both her hip and ankle continued to trouble her for months after the tournament, forcing her to skip the clay court season. [151] [152] After playing once in March and returning in mid-June, [151] [153] the last WTA events of Clijsters\\'s career were the final two Grand Slam tournaments of the season. [78] She lost at Wimbledon in the fourth round to No. 8 Angelique Kerber , only winning two games. [154] Clijsters entered the US Open having not lost a match there since the 2003 final. She recorded her last WTA singles match win against Victoria Duval in the first round before falling to Laura Robson in her next match. [155] Her career ended with a second round mixed doubles loss alongside Bob Bryan to the eventual champions Ekaterina Makarova and Bruno Soares , at which point she officially retired. [155] [156]   National representation [ edit ]  Fed Cup [ edit ]  Clijsters made her Fed Cup debut for Belgium in 2000 at the age of 16. The top-tier World Group that year consisted of 13 teams, 12 of which were divided into three round robin groups. The winners of the round robin groups in April would compete with the defending champion United States team in a knockout format for the title in November. Belgium was placed in a group with Australia , France , and Russia . Each tie was contested over one day as a best-of-three rubbers, two in singles and the last in doubles. Clijsters only played singles, while Els Callens and Laurence Courtois played all three doubles matches. Although Clijsters narrowly lost her debut to Jelena Dokic of Australia by a score of 9–7 in the third set, her teammates were able to secure the tie. She won her other two matches against Nathalie Tauziat of France and Anna Kournikova of Russia, both of which were crucial as Belgium won each of those ties 2–1 as well to win the group. In the semifinals, Henin returned to the team as they faced the United States, the hosts for the final rounds. After Henin lost to Monica Seles , Clijsters needed to defeat Lindsay Davenport to keep Belgium in the tournament. She won the second set, but ultimately lost the match. [157]  The following year, the format for the Fed Cup changed again. The entire competition was played out in November. The three round robin pools were reduced to two and the winners of each pool would contest a final tie for the title. Belgium\\'s team of Clijsters, Henin, Callens, and Courtois from the 2000 final all returned for 2001 . The United States withdrew before the start of the event, citing security concerns a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks . With Henin and Clijsters exclusively playing singles, and Callens and Courtois playing doubles, Belgium won all nine of their rubbers against Spain , Germany , and Australia to advance to the final. Facing Russia, Henin defeated Nadia Petrova and Clijsters defeated Elena Dementieva to secure Belgium\\'s first Fed Cup crown. Courtois commented, \"We were never under any pressure, mainly because Kim and Justine were so strong.\" [158]  While Clijsters and Henin were on the team, Belgium came closest to another Fed Cup triumph in 2006. In this year, the World Group consisted of eight teams in a knockout tournament. The three rounds were spread out over April, July, and September. Each tie was played as a best-of-five rubbers, with four singles followed by one doubles. In the first round against Russia, both Clijsters and Henin made themselves available and won three out of four singles matches to advance. [159] Although Henin missed the semifinal, Clijsters and Kirsten Flipkens were able to lead Belgium to a victory over the United States, who were also short-handed without Lindsay Davenport or the Williams sisters. [160] However, Clijsters was forced to miss the Fed Cup final due to a wrist injury. [98] Henin and Flipkens returned for the final, which Belgium hosted against Italy . The tie was decided by the doubles rubber, which Belgium lost after Henin aggravated a knee injury she suffered in one of her singles rubbers and needed to retire down 2–0 in the third set. [161]  Clijsters also played on the Belgium Fed Cup team from 2002–05, and 2010–11 after she returned from retirement. The team\\'s best results in those years were two semifinal appearances in 2003 and 2011 . Clijsters missed the ties in which Belgium was eliminated in both instances. [162] [163] Overall, Clijsters compiled a 24–4 record in Fed Cup, split across 21–3 in singles and 3–1 in doubles. [164]   Hopman Cup [ edit ]  Clijsters participated in the Hopman Cup from 2001–04, partnering with Olivier Rochus in the first instance and Xavier Malisse thereafter. The tournament consists of eight teams, each with one female and one male player from the same country. The teams are divided into two round robin groups, the winners of which compete for the title. Each tie consists of a women\\'s singles match, a men\\'s singles match, and a mixed doubles match. The Belgian team did not advance to final in any of the years Clijsters participated. Their best performances came in 2002 and 2003 when they won two out of three round robin ties. [165] [166] [167] [168]  In 2002, they finished tied for first with the United States and Italy in a group that also featured France. Belgium\\'s only loss came against the United States, with Clijsters and Malisse losing both singles matches to Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill respectively. Although the United States lost to Italy, they advanced out of the group on the tiebreak criteria, having won six rubbers compared to the five won by each of Belgium and Italy. Both of the ties Belgium had won were by a score of 2–1, with Clijsters losing to Francesca Schiavone against Italy and the pair losing the mixed doubles against the French team of Virginie Razzano and Arnaud Clément . [166] The following year, Clijsters and Malisse again lost to the United States, who fielded a different team of Serena Williams and James Blake . [167]   Olympics [ edit ]  Clijsters did not compete at the Olympics until 2012 near the end of her career. She had been ranked inside the top 40 in the months leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics in September, high enough to qualify. However, she did not make herself available for selection for a variety of reasons including issues with her shoulder and the event\\'s timing a week after the US Open. [169] During the 2004 Athens Olympics , she was in the middle of a long absence from competition after undergoing wrist surgery. [72] However, she had announced before the year began that she did not intend to compete at the Games because Adidas was the Belgian team\\'s uniform sponsor and her contract with Fila forbade her from wearing clothing from another company. [170] The 2008 Beijing Olympics took place during her first retirement. [150]  Having missed these three previous events, Clijsters\\'s desire to represent Belgium at the Olympics was one of the underlying reasons why she prolonged her second career until the 2012 London Games in late July. [150] At the time, she did not have good results at her most recent tournaments, withdrawing from the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships in the semifinals in June due to injury and suffering a lopsided loss in the fourth round at Wimbledon. In her Olympic debut, Clijsters won her first three matches in straight sets, defeating Roberta Vinci , Carla Suárez Navarro , and No. 12 Ana Ivanovic in succession. [78] She faced No. 3 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets one match before the medal rounds. [150] [171]   Rivalries [ edit ]  Clijsters vs. Henin [ edit ]  Main article: Clijsters–Henin rivalry  Clijsters\\'s biggest rival was Justine Henin, who grew up in the French-speaking part of Belgium. They have been regarded as having little in common except their nationality and their relationship has varied over time. [172] Their rivalry began during their junior years when they were both considered promising young talents. [6] They started out as friends and won the Belgian Junior Championships as doubles partners at ages ten and eleven respectively, despite only being able to communicate with hand signals due to Clijsters not knowing French and Henin not knowing Flemish. [5] [6] [159] However, their friendship began to fade by their mid-teens, leading to disputes that their coaches would try to keep out of the media. [173] Clijsters attributed this deterioration in part to one of Henin\\'s coaches telling Henin, \"she had to hate all of her opponents, and only then could she win.\" She also acknowledged they had very different personalities. [174]  Clijsters and Henin typically downplayed any disagreements between them, saying they were overdramatized by the media. [5] [172] When they were professionals, Clijsters accused Henin of routinely faking injuries in their matches to receive medical timeouts. Additionally, Clijsters\\'s father seemed to allege that Henin was taking performance-enhancing drugs . [5] [172] Although they had won the Fed Cup together in 2001, they were not interested in playing on the same team in 2004 or 2005. The following year, Clijsters\\'s former coach Carl Maes, who was then the Belgium Fed Cup captain, helped convince Clijsters to reunite with Henin, and together they ultimately reached another final. [159]  On the court, they played each other in 25 WTA matches, making each of them the other\\'s most frequent opponent. Although Clijsters won the series 13–12, Henin won seven out of their eleven meetings in finals including all three at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest stage win Clijsters had at a major was in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open. She also defeated Henin en route to her first WTA Tour Championship in 2002. Clijsters dominated their hard court meetings 8–4, while Henin dominated on clay 5–1. Henin also won three of their five grass court encounters. Before both of their first retirements, Henin was leading the series 12–10. However, Clijsters won all three of their meetings during their comebacks to win the series. [41]   Clijsters vs. Williams sisters [ edit ]  The Williams sisters are widely recognized as dominating tennis since around the turn of the century. [175] They were both No. 1 in the world and combined for 15 Grand Slam singles titles while Clijsters was on tour. [176] [177] Clijsters had a record of just 2–7 against Serena, who she called her toughest opponent. [7] [178] She fared better against Venus, compiling a winning record of 7–6. [179]  Clijsters\\'s rivalry with Serena included two of the biggest controversies in Serena\\'s career: the 2001 Indian Wells final which led to both Williams sisters\\' long boycott of the tournament, and the 2009 US Open semifinal which Serena lost on a point penalty. [30] [117] Serena defeated Clijsters in their first five meetings. She also won all four of their three-set encounters, including their 1999 US Open third round match and their 2003 Australian Open semifinal where Clijsters had the opportunity to serve for both matches. [21] [43] [178] Although Clijsters only had two wins against Serena, both were considered big upsets and among the most important wins of her career. Her victory in the 2002 WTA Tour Championship final gave Clijsters her biggest title at the time, and her win at the 2009 US Open set up her first Grand Slam singles title as a mother one match later. [23] [180] Clijsters also defeated Venus in both of those tournaments, making her the only player to record wins over both Williams sisters at the same event twice. [181]  Venus also initially dominated her rivalry with Clijsters. She won six of their first eight meetings, including two in the late stages of Grand Slam tournaments in the quarterfinals of the 2001 US Open and the semifinals of 2003 Wimbledon. Venus also eliminated Clijsters from the Diamond Games in Belgium twice in 2003 and 2005. Additionally, one of Clijsters\\'s first two wins against Venus was a retirement due to injury at the 2002 WTA Tour Championships. Nonetheless, Clijsters rebounded to win their last five meetings and end her career leading in their head-to-head record. Three of those five victories came at the US Open en route to her three titles at the event in 2005, 2009, and 2010. [179]   Other rivals [ edit ]  In addition to Henin and the Williams sisters, Clijsters also developed rivalries with several other players who had been ranked No. 1 in the world. Two of her most frequent opponents were Lindsay Davenport and Amélie Mauresmo. Clijsters narrowly had winning records against both of them, going 9–8 versus Davenport and 8–7 versus Mauresmo. Davenport had won six of their first seven meetings before Clijsters won eight of their next nine encounters, including all five in 2003. Clijsters defeated Davenport in all four of their meetings in finals, including two at the Indian Wells Open. While Davenport had a 5–1 lead in Grand Slam tournaments, Clijsters won their latest-stage such meeting in the semifinals of the 2003 US Open. [182] Unlike against Davenport, Clijsters initially dominated her rivalry with Mauresmo, winning eight of their first ten matches before Mauresmo took the last five. They met in two WTA Tour Championship finals, which they split. Mauresmo also denied Clijsters chances to win more titles in her home country when she won their finals at both the 2006 and 2007 Diamond Games. [183]   Exhibition matches [ edit ]   King Baudouin Stadium , the site of the record-setting match between Clijsters and Serena Williams  During Clijsters\\'s first retirement, the invitation to participate in the roof test exhibition series at Wimbledon in May 2009 inspired her to return to the WTA Tour. [108] In the summer, she joined the St. Louis Aces of the World Team Tennis league to help prepare for her comeback. [184] She also participated in World Team Tennis the following year as a member of the New York Sportimes . [185] Ten years after the roof test on Centre Court that inspired her comeback, Clijsters returned to Wimbledon to participate in an exhibition series to test the new roof on Court No. 1 in which she played a set of singles against Venus Williams as well as a set of mixed doubles. [186]  On 8 July 2010, an exhibition match between Clijsters and Henin was scheduled as an attempt to set a new world record for largest attendance at a tennis match. The contest took place at the King Baudouin Stadium and was a part of the Best of Belgium national festival. After Henin needed to withdraw from the match due to an elbow injury, Serena Williams was chosen as a replacement. Although Williams injured her foot several days before the match, she chose to play. Clijsters defeated Williams in straight sets. A total of 35,681 people attended the match, breaking the world record of 30,472 set in 1973 by the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs . [187]  Beginning in 2009, the Diamond Games in Antwerp was reorganized from a WTA tournament into an exhibition series. During her comeback, Clijsters played at the event three times, winning matches against Venus Williams in 2009, [188] Henin in 2010, [189] and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in 2011. [190] She continued to play at the event after retiring. The 2012 edition was named \"Kim\\'s Thank You Games\" in honor of her retirement, and the following year the event was known as the Kim Clijsters Invitational. [191] [192] In 2015 , the Diamond Games were revived as a WTA event with Clijsters serving as the tournament director. She also played an exhibition set with finalist Andrea Petkovic after her opponent withdrew before the start of the championship match due to injury. [193]  Since her retirement in 2012, Clijsters has regularly played in the legends, champions, and invitation doubles events at all four Grand Slam tournaments. [194] [195] [196] One of her matches in the 2017 Wimbledon ladies\\' invitation doubles event drew public interest for Clijsters inviting a male spectator onto the court to play a few points. The spectator, Chris Quinn, had suggested Clijsters try a body serve when she had asked the crowd whether she should serve left or right. Before playing the points, she gave Quinn a women\\'s shirt and skort so that he could abide by Wimbledon\\'s all-white dress code. A video of the incident has over four million views on YouTube. [197] [198]   Legacy [ edit ]  Clijsters has been ranked as the 14th greatest women\\'s tennis player in the Open Era by Tennis.com . [199] Her 41 singles titles are the 14th-most in the Open Era. [200] Since 2000, only the Williams sisters, Justine Henin, and Maria Sharapova have won more than her four Grand Slam singles titles. [201] The three titles she won at the WTA Tour Championships are tied for the fifth-most in history behind only Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, and Chris Evert. [202] Clijsters was a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the French Open and Wimbledon in doubles and the US Open and Australian Open in singles. [24] Her prowess at singles and doubles is also highlighted by her becoming one of six players in WTA history to be No. 1 in the world in both rankings at the same time. [53]  Clijsters and Henin are recognized for \"putting Belgium on the tennis map\". [199] Before they established themselves in the upper echelon of women\\'s tennis, Dominique Van Roost was the only player in Belgian history to be ranked in the top ten of the ATP or WTA rankings, a mark she did not achieve until 1998 after Clijsters and Henin turned professional. [203] The Belgium Fed Cup team had never reached the quarterfinals until 1997 when they made the semifinals. With Clijsters on the team, Belgium made it to at least the semifinals four times, reaching the final in 2006 and winning the championship in 2001. [204] She also became the first Belgian to be ranked No. 1 in each of singles and doubles. [39] Belgium was regarded as dominating women\\'s tennis when Clijsters and Henin were the top two players in the world for several months in late 2003. [172] After Clijsters\\'s retirement, she established the Kim Clijsters Academy in her hometown of Bree. The academy is run by Clijsters\\'s longtime coach Carl Maes and is intended to serve young players. [205] Compatriot Elise Mertens is among those who train at the facility. [206]  Clijsters was one of the most popular and well-liked players in tennis among both fans and her fellow players. [180] [199] She won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award a record eight times. Clijsters was proud of her reputation as one of the nicest players on the WTA Tour, saying, \"I always try every day to be a good person and to be nice to others, and I think that’s probably the most important thing. I’m proud that I won tournaments and everything, but I want players to think that Kim was a nice person.\" [207] Clijsters was also regarded as a source of inspiration to mothers on the WTA Tour, a role she embraced. [208] She is one of three mothers to win a Grand Slam singles title, and her three such titles are tied with Margaret Court for the most of all-time. Additionally, Clijsters is the only mother to be ranked No. 1 in the world since the start of the WTA rankings in 1975. [209] She appeared on the Time 100 list in 2011 as one of the most influential people in the world in large part because of her successful comeback. [210]   Playing style [ edit ]   Clijsters serving  Clijsters was an all-court player who employed a mixture of offensive and defensive styles of play. [24] On the defensive side, her movement was regarded as exceptional, enabling her to endure long rallies. [24] [211] Maria Sharapova has commented that, \"You just have to expect that she\\'s going to get every ball back.\" [212] In addition to her movement, Clijsters often extended points with her signature shot, a stretched-out wide forehand , also known as a squash shot. This type of forehand involves hitting the ball with slice to make up for being out of position. [213] When hitting a squash shot on the run, Clijsters was known for her trademark play of sliding towards the ball and finishing in a split to extend her reach. [214] While most players can only slide on clay, Clijsters could slide on any surface. Tennis journalist Peter Bodo has noted, \"Grass and hard courts do not \\'permit\\' sliding unless your name is Kim Clijsters.\" [215]    Clijsters hitting a backhand  The strengths of Clijsters\\'s game were built around playing aggressively to generate offense without losing control. [216] She excelled at hitting both forehand and backhand winners from the baseline. [217] Clijsters was regarded as one of the best returners of serve and would try to \"take control of the point immediately... to [put herself] in an offensive position from the beginning\". [218] She was aggressive in the middle of points as well. While the squash shot is generally regarded as a defensive shot, Clijsters could turn it into an offensive weapon by placing it well enough to have time to recover into a good court position. [213] Additionally, she possessed the ability to quickly move in from the baseline to the net, setting herself up to hit winners and finish points. She was adept at hitting swinging volleys on both the forehand and backhand sides because of her solid groundstroke technique. [219] Clijsters credited her experience in doubles for improving her net game in singles, saying \"it made [her] focus on going to the net more\" and helped her \"know when to come to the net\". [220] Her coach Wim Fissette attributed her success at Grand Slam events after her comeback to being more aggressive than she was before her first retirement. [221]   Coaches [ edit ]  Clijsters worked with Belgian coaches throughout her career. Her first coach was Bart Van Kerckhoven, who she later invited to her championship match at the 2010 US Open. [187] She began her professional career with Carl Maes as her coach. Maes was a student of Benny Vanhoudt who led the Saturday training sessions while Clijsters was also working with Vanhoudt in Diest. [8] He moved to the Flemish Tennis Association Centre in Wilrijk when Clijsters was 13 years old and invited her to join him. In her first year in Wilrijk, she also worked with Marc De Hous. [9] Maes coached Clijsters from 1996 to May 2002, during which she won the Fed Cup and finished as the runner-up at the 2001 French Open. [173]  Shortly before the 2002 US Open , she hired De Hous as her new coach and continued to work with him through 2005. Under De Hous, Clijsters won two WTA Tour Championships and two Grand Slam doubles titles. They split a week after she won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 2005 US Open. It was reported that De Hous left because he was unhappy with only receiving a $7,500 bonus from her $2.2 million in US Open prize money; however, he denied this was his only financial compensation and attributed his departure to wanting to \"take on new challenges\" after all of their success in 2005. [79] [222] [223] Clijsters opted to play without a coach from then until her first retirement. [224]  When Clijsters began her comeback in 2009, she hired Wim Fissette to be her coach. Fissette, who is three years older, had trained with Clijsters under Vanhoudt when they were both juniors. [8] He had also served as her hitting partner from 2005 until her first retirement. [225] With Fissette as her coach, Clijsters won three more Grand Slam singles titles and regained the world No. 1 ranking. In June 2011, she rehired Maes as her coach, leading to Fissette\\'s departure several months later. [226] [227] Clijsters worked with Maes through the end of her career. [155]   Endorsements [ edit ]  During her playing career, Clijsters was represented by Belgian company Golazo Sports. [228] [229]  Babolat has sponsored her racquets since 1999, and she specifically has used the Pure Drive model. [230] Fila has been Clijsters\\'s clothing sponsor since 2002. She had previously worn Nike apparel, but was not under contract. [231] [232]  Clijsters is conscious about selecting which products to endorse, saying, \"If it\\'s not healthy for kids, for example, I\\'m not going to endorse a product. I don\\'t want to give the wrong impression. We try to live a healthy lifestyle and if it doesn\\'t match me as a person, I turn it down. To have my name on a product, I want to be behind it fully.\" [233] She has turned down Nutella in addition to endorsements that involved her daughter. [234] [235] While on tour, she endorsed banana supplier Chiquita and United Soft Drinks , the producer of the AA sports drink. [235] Additionally, she was a brand ambassador for nutrition company USANA as well as the Citizen Watch Signature Collection. [236] [237] She also had endorsement deals with Belgian telecommunications company Telenet , personnel services firm Adecco , and the travel services company Thomas Cook Group . [235]  Since Clijsters\\'s retirement, Van Lanschot banking helps sponsor the Kim Clijsters Academy. [238]   Personal life [ edit ]  Clijsters is married to Brian Lynch , an American basketball coach and former player. Lynch played college basketball at Villanova before pursuing a professional career in Europe. The two met while Lynch was a member of Euphony Bree , the team based in Clijsters\\'s hometown, and initially bonded over both having pet bulldogs. They became a couple in 2005 and married in 2007. [108] They have three children: a daughter Jada (born 2008), and two sons Jack  (born 2013) and Blake (born 2016). The family splits their time living in Bree and New Jersey . [239]  Clijsters\\'s sister Elke , who is younger by a year and a half, was also a promising tennis player. Like Kim, Elke won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles. [240] She was also the ITF World Junior Doubles Champion in 2002. [241] On the professional tour, she achieved a top 400 ranking in singles and a top 250 ranking in doubles. [242] Kim and Elke entered one doubles tournament together on the WTA Tour at the 2004 Diamond Games in Antwerp. They won their opening match against Selima Sfar and Caroline Vis before losing to the second-seeded team of Emilie Loit and Petra Mandula in the next round. [17] Elke retired in 2004 at age 19 due to persistent back problems. [243]  In Clijsters\\'s early career, she was in a long-term relationship with Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. They met at the 2000 Australian Open and were engaged before mutually ending their relationship in late 2004. [244] The pair entered the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon in 2000, losing in the final. [23] Their relationship earned Clijsters the nickname \"Aussie Kim\" and made her popular among Australian tennis fans even after they separated. When Clijsters won the 2011 Australian Open, she believed she earned her nickname, saying, \"Now you can finally call me Aussie Kim\". [137]  Clijsters\\'s childhood tennis idol was Steffi Graf. [2] She cites her lone WTA Tour match against Graf at Wimbledon in 1999 as being very influential, saying, \"It was unbelievable. All I wanted to do was watch her. I wanted to see how she tied her shoelaces, what her ponytail looked like, how she carried her bag. Even though I lost, the impact of that and the motivation it gave me was huge. It was definitely the biggest moment of my career\". [239] She also looked up to Monica Seles and viewed both Graf and Seles as role models, drawing inspiration from their level of focus. [2] [220]  Clijsters is involved with multiple organizations that help children. She has served as an ambassador for SOS Children\\'s Villages in Belgium since 2010. SOS provides aid to children living without their parents and to impoverished families. [245] [246] Clijsters has also founded Ten4Kim, a nonprofit that funds junior tennis players who cannot afford the costs associated with training at a high level. [247] [248]  Since Clijsters retired, she has served as a part-time coach to several players, including compatriots Elise Mertens and Yanina Wickmayer . She has also occasionally been a commentator at the Grand Slam tournaments, working for the BBC and Fox Sports Australia at Wimbledon and for Channel 7 at the Australian Open.

Clijsters was a world No. 1 in both singles and doubles, having held both rankings simultaneously in 2003. She won a total of six Grand Slam tournament titles, four in singles and two in doubles. Clijsters competed professionally from 1997 to 2012 in an era in which her primary rivals were compatriot Justine Henin and 23-time Grand Slam singles champion Serena Williams . Coming from a country with limited success in men\\'s or women\\'s tennis, Clijsters became the first Belgian player to attain the No. 1 ranking. Together with Henin, she established Belgium as a leading force in women\\'s tennis as the two of them led their country to their first Fed Cup crown in 2001 and were the top two players in the world in late 2003. Individually, Clijsters won 41 singles titles and 11 doubles titles on the Women\\'s Tennis Association (WTA) Tour. She was a three-time winner of the WTA Tour Championships . Between singles and doubles, she was a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the US Open and the Australian Open in singles and Wimbledon and the French Open in doubles with Ai Sugiyama . Her success at majors was highlighted by winning three consecutive appearances at the US Open. Plagued by injuries and having lost some of her desire to compete, Clijsters initially retired from tennis in 2007 at the age of 23 to get married and have a daughter. She returned to the sport two years later and won her second US Open title as an unranked player in just her third tournament back. She defended her title the following year and then won the Australian Open in 2011 en route to becoming the first mother to be ranked No. 1 by the WTA. Along with Margaret Court , she also holds the record for most Grand Slam singles titles won as a mother, with three such titles, and was the first to win one since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. After being retired from professional tennis for seven years since the 2012 US Open, Clijsters announced she is planning another comeback in 2020. Clijsters was born to athletic parents with backgrounds in professional football and gymnastics. She was renowned for her athleticism, which was highlighted by her ability to perform splits on court in the middle of points. She built the offensive side of her game around controlled aggression while also using her exceptional movement to become an elite defensive player. Clijsters was very popular and well-liked as a player, having won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award eight times. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.

She grew up with her younger sister Elke in the nearby town of Bree in the Flemish province of Limburg . [2] Kim is the daughter of Lei Clijsters and Els Vandecaetsbeek, both of whom were accomplished athletes. Her mother Els was a Belgian national artistic gymnastics champion. Her father Lei was a professional football  defender who played for a variety of clubs in the top-flight Belgian First Division , including KV Mechelen with whom he won the UEFA Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1988. He was also a member of the Belgium national football team , tallying 40 caps and competing in two World Cups . [3] [4] Clijsters credits her parents for giving her a footballer\\'s legs and a gymnast\\'s flexibility. [1] She also attributes her success to the freedom they gave her when she was a young player, saying, \"Without the support I\\'ve had from my family, I wouldn\\'t be where I am. They\\'ve let me make my own decisions.\" [5]  When Clijsters was five years old, her father built a clay tennis court at their home as a gift to his daughter to celebrate him winning the 1988 Gouden Schoen , an award given to the player of the year in the Belgian First Division. He had previously announced the idea of the gift as a celebration of the award during a television interview. [3] [6] [7] Clijsters began playing tennis earlier that year after attending a lesson with her cousins and her uncle while her parents were away. [2] From then on, she became fixated on the sport. She began playing with her sister at the Tennisdel club in Genk by the time she was seven. Her first coach Bart Van Kerckhoven recalled that she was extremely energetic and never wanted to leave the tennis court, adding that, \"If the group before her did some sprints to finish off the session, Kim would join in. Then she put her heart and soul into her own training session, after which she joined the next group for their warm-up exercises.\" [6]  At the age of nine, Clijsters began working with Benny Vanhoudt in the more distant town of Diest . Along with her sister, she trained for fifteen hours a week, including five hours of individual instruction, which Vanhoudt said was \"an insane amount [of total hours].\" [8] She continued to train in Diest until she was twelve. During this time, she also first worked with Carl Maes and Wim Fissette , both of whom would coach Clijsters later in her professional career. When she was thirteen, Maes took over as her primary coach at the Flemish Tennis Association in Antwerp . [9]   Junior career [ edit ]  Clijsters had success at both the national and international levels at a very young age. In 1993, she won the 12-and-under division of the Belgian Junior Championships (the Coupe de Borman) in doubles with her future longtime rival Justine Henin . At the time, Clijsters was ten years old and Henin was eleven. [6] A year later, she won the 12-and-under singles event at the same tournament. [10] Clijsters continued to play alongside Henin, winning the doubles event at the 14-and-under European Junior Championships as well as the 14-and-under European Junior Team Championships for Belgium, both in 1996 and the latter of which also with Leslie Butkiewicz . [6] [11] Her first big international junior title came at Les Petits As , a high-level 14-and-under tournament. She defeated future top 25 players Iveta Benešová and Elena Bovina in the semifinals and final respectively. [6]  Clijsters played two full seasons on the ITF Junior Circuit , the premier junior tour that is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). At the very end of 1997, she partnered with Zsófia Gubacsi to win her first ITF title in the doubles event at the Grade A Orange Bowl , one of the highest level junior tournaments. [12] In 1998, Clijsters had her best year on the junior tour, finishing the season at career-high rankings of world No. 11 in singles and world No. 4 in doubles. [13] [14] She won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles, the French Open with Jelena Dokic and the US Open with Eva Dyrberg . [15] [16] She defeated her French Open partner Dokic in the US Open doubles final. [16] In singles, she made it to the Wimbledon final, but finished runner-up to Katarina Srebotnik . [9]   Professional career [ edit ]  1997–99: Maiden WTA title, Newcomer of the Year [ edit ]   Clijsters (right) with her idol Steffi Graf in 2009. Graf won their only meeting on the WTA Tour in 1999.  As a fourteen year old, Clijsters could only enter professional tournaments through qualifying since the WTA Tour\\'s policy did not allow players her age to receive main draw wild cards . In August 1997, Clijsters qualified for her first main draw at her second career tournament on the lower-level ITF Women\\'s Circuit , which was held in the Belgian coastal town of Koksijde . She won seven matches in total, including five in qualifying, to reach the quarterfinals. Clijsters did not enter another professional tournament until after her runner-up finish at the Wimbledon girls\\' singles event the following summer. Playing in Brussels in July 1998, she won both the singles and doubles events for her first career professional titles. Clijsters continued to excel at the ITF level, winning four more titles within the next year, two in both singles and doubles. [9] [17]  Clijsters began 1999 with a WTA singles ranking of No. 420 in the world. [18] Around this time, Belgian women\\'s tennis was beginning to flourish. Both Dominique Van Roost and Sabine Appelmans had been ranked in the top 20 within the previous two years, complementing the rise of Clijsters and Henin on the junior tour. This success helped lead to the revival of the only WTA tournament in Belgium, which was relaunched as the Flanders Women\\'s Open in Antwerp after not being held in six years. Clijsters made her WTA debut at the tournament in May, entering the main draw as a lucky loser after losing in the final round of qualifying. She won her first career tour-level match against Miho Saeki and advanced to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by top seed Sarah Pitkowski despite holding match points. [19]  One week after Clijsters turned sixteen, she entered Wimbledon as the youngest player in the top 200. After barely having a high enough ranking to get into the qualifying draw, she ultimately made it to the round of sixteen in her Grand Slam tournament debut. She defeated world No. 10 Amanda Coetzer in the third round and did not drop a set until losing to Steffi Graf one round later, her only career match against her childhood idol. [2] [20] [21] Clijsters also had a good showing at the US Open , losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams in the third round after squandering a chance to serve for the match. [21] Clijsters next played at the Luxembourg Open held in the town of Kockelscheuer just outside the capital. She won the title with relative ease in just her fourth career WTA event, taking affinity for the friendly atmosphere of the smaller tournament and the faster carpet courts. Most notably, she faced off against Van Roost in the final and only conceded four games to the top-ranked Belgian. [22] Clijsters also made the singles final in Bratislava at her next tournament, finishing runner-up to No. 11 Amélie Mauresmo . Nonetheless, she was able to win the doubles event with compatriot Laurence Courtois as her partner. [23] At the end of the season, Clijsters was named WTA Newcomer of the Year , having risen to No. 47 in the world. [24]   2000–02: French Open finalist, Tour champion [ edit ]  Clijsters was unable to repeat her success at the Grand Slam tournaments in 2000, not advancing past the second round at any of the singles events. [17] However, she continued her steady climb in the rankings up to No. 18 on the strength of two more titles, [18] one at the Tasmanian International in her first tournament of the year [25] and another at the Sparkassen Cup in Germany near the end of the season. [26] The latter victory was Clijsters\\'s first at a Tier II event (the second highest level tournament) and followed up a loss in another Tier II final to world No. 1 Martina Hingis earlier that month. [27] In the middle of the year, Clijsters also finished runner-up at the Wimbledon mixed doubles event alongside her boyfriend Lleyton Hewitt . [23]    The Kockelscheuer Sport Centre , where Clijsters won five Luxembourg Open titles, including three consecutive in 2001–03.  At the Indian Wells Open in early 2001, Clijsters finally defeated Hingis in her fourth meeting against the world No. 1 player to reach her first Tier I final. [28] After winning the first set of the final, she ended up losing in three sets to Serena Williams. The match was overshadowed by the controversy of the crowd booing Williams for her sister Venus \\'s late withdrawal from their semifinal, leading to both sisters boycotting the tournament for 14 years . [29] [30] A few months later at the French Open , Clijsters became the first Belgian to contest a Grand Slam singles final. She had defeated No. 16 Henin in the semifinals in their closest and highest profile match to date, coming back from a set and a break down, and also having saved three break points that would have put her behind 5–2 in the second set. [31] The final against Australian Open champion and world No. 4 Jennifer Capriati was an even tighter match. Playing a day after her 18th birthday, Clijsters won the first set but lost the second. After a French Open final record 22 games and 2 hours 21 minutes in total, she was defeated by Capriati 12–10 in the deciding set. [32] [33] The match was ranked as the greatest French Open women\\'s final in Open Era history by Tennis.com . [33] Clijsters would go on to make it to at least the quarterfinals at each of the next three majors. [17] She also played in her first Grand Slam doubles final at Wimbledon later that year, with Ai Sugiyama as her partner. [34] She won three singles titles in 2001, including her second titles at both the Luxembourg Open and the Sparkassen Cup , to help her finish the season at No. 5 in the world. With four doubles finals in total, she was also ranked No. 15 in doubles at the end of the year. [17] [18]  Clijsters maintained her top ten ranking throughout 2002 [18] despite struggling with an ongoing shoulder injury in the first half of the year. [35] Her best result at a Grand Slam event came at the Australian Open , where she lost another three-set match to Capriati in the semifinals in their first meeting since the French Open final. [36] Nonetheless, she continued to rise in the rankings to No. 3 by March, her best ranking for the season. [18] Although Clijsters did not reach another Grand Slam quarterfinal the rest of the year, she won three more titles leading up to the year-end WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles . [17] She received her third invite to the event, which only the top 16 players in the world are guaranteed entry. Clijsters made it to the final with ease after dropping only six games in the first three rounds, including a victory over Henin in the quarterfinals [37] and a retirement due to injury from Venus Williams in the semifinals. Her opponent in the final was Serena Williams, who entered the match with a 56–4 record on the season and having won the last three majors of the year. Although Serena had won their first five encounters and was considered a clear favourite, Clijsters upset Serena in straight sets to win the championship. [38] After the tournament, she said, \"This is the best victory of my career.\" [35]   2003: World No. 1 in singles and doubles [ edit ]  The 2003 season was Clijsters\\'s \" annus mirabilis \". [39] She competed in 21 singles events, reaching the semifinals in all but one of them, advancing to 15 finals, and winning nine titles. With a record of 90–12, she was the first player to accrue 90 wins since Martina Navratilova in 1982 and the first to play more than 100 matches since Chris Evert in 1974. [40] Clijsters also played an extensive doubles schedule, compiling a total of 170 matches between both disciplines. [39] She partnered with Sugiyama the entire year, winning seven titles in thirteen events. [17] This season also marked the peak of the rivalry between Clijsters and Henin , as the pair faced each other eight matches, the last six of which were in finals. [41] In doubles, five of her ten finals were against the team of Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez . [17] With her success, Clijsters became the first Belgian world No. 1 in singles or doubles, achieving both feats in August. [18]   Singles: Two Grand Slam finals, Tour Championship defense [ edit ]  Clijsters began her singles season by winning the Sydney International over Lindsay Davenport , her third consecutive title. [42] She extended her tour win streak to 17 matches—all without dropping a set [17] —before she was defeated by Serena Williams in an Australian Open semifinal where she had a 5–1 lead in the third set as well as two match points on serve. She said afterwards, \"The only thing I regret a little bit, is those two double faults [to start the game at 5–4]. I could feel that she was really trying to step it up, and that she was hitting the balls a lot more aggressive and had almost no unforced errors at the end.\" [43] [44] Williams won the title to complete her \"Serena Slam\". [45] After losing in the final at her next two tournaments, Clijsters recovered at the Indian Wells Open to win her first Tier I title. Like in Sydney, she defeated Davenport in the final. [46] She won another Tier I title on clay in May at the Italian Open over No. 4 Amélie Mauresmo, who had a chance to serve for the match in the second set. [47]  At the French Open , both Clijsters and Henin reached the final to guarantee that the winner would become the first Belgian Grand Slam singles champion. [39] Henin had won their only meeting in a final in 2003 thus far at the German Open , which was also their only other encounter on clay. [41] While both players had match points in Germany, [48] Henin won in Paris in a lopsided affair where she only lost four games. [49] After losing in the semifinals at Wimbledon to Venus Williams, [50] Clijsters rebounded to win two Tier II titles at the Stanford Classic [51] and the Los Angeles Open . With the second of those titles, she attained the world No. 1 ranking, in part because the top-ranked Serena Williams had not played on tour since Wimbledon due to a knee injury. [39] She was the first woman to become No. 1 without winning a Grand Slam singles title. [40] [52] Clijsters regained the top ranking in doubles the following week to become only the fifth player in WTA history to be No. 1 in singles and doubles simultaneously. [40] [53] Despite playing the US Open as the top seed, Clijsters again lost to Henin in the final in straight sets. Clijsters had been regarded as the favourite entering the match because of her performance in the earlier rounds and Henin\\'s lengthy semifinal match the previous day. [39] [54] The title helped Henin rise to No. 2 in the world. [55]  The last stage of the season featured Clijsters battling Henin for the top ranking. Clijsters defeated Henin in the final of the Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt to defend her title and her world No. 1 ranking. This was the eighth time in WTA history where the top two players in the world faced off for the top ranking. [56] Although Clijsters lost the top ranking to Henin the following week, [57] she regained it a week later by winning the Luxembourg Open for the third year in a row. [18] [58] She finished her season by defending her title at the WTA Tour Championships in the first year where the tournament switched to a round robin format in the initial stage. Clijsters swept her group of Mauresmo, Elena Dementieva , and Chanda Rubin . [59] She won her semifinal against Capriati before defeating Mauresmo again for the title. With the million dollar prize, Clijsters finished the season as the tour prize money leader and became the first player to earn four million dollars in a season on the WTA Tour. [60] Nonetheless, Henin took the year-end No. 1 ranking by improving on her performance at the event from the previous season. [61]   Doubles: French Open and Wimbledon titles [ edit ]   Ai Sugiyama , Clijsters\\'s doubles partner in 2003  In the early part of the season, Clijsters and Sugiyama won three titles on hard courts. [17] However, they did not win any big titles through May, losing in the Australian Open quarterfinals to the Williams sisters and finishing runners-up at their first two Tier I finals. [17] [62] They entered the French Open and Wimbledon and made it to the finals at both events. Clijsters and Sugiyama defeated the top seeds Ruano Pascual and Suarez in both finals for Clijsters\\'s first two Grand Slam tournament titles. The French Open final was a tighter match, ending 9–7 in the third set. [39] [63] Despite these titles, the duo remained behind Ruano Pascual and Suarez in the rankings until August when Clijsters became world No. 1. She held the top ranking for four non-consecutive weeks. [18] [64] The pair were the top seeds at the US Open, but withdrew in the second round due to rain delaying Sugiyama\\'s fourth round singles match for three days. [65] They ended the season by finishing runners-up to Ruano Pascual and Suarez at the WTA Tour Championships. [66] Despite Clijsters\\'s success in 2003, she seldom played doubles during the rest of her career. [67]   2004–05: Extended injury absence, first Grand Slam singles title [ edit ]  Although Clijsters maintained her form into 2004, her season was ultimately marred by injuries. It was feared that she would need surgery and miss the Australian Open after she injured her left ankle in the Hopman Cup . [68] Nonetheless, she competed at the event and reached the championship match without dropping a set, despite aggravating her ankle injury in the quarterfinals. [69] Her opponent in the final was Henin and unlike their previous two Grand Slam finals, Clijsters was able to win a set. With Henin up a break at 4–3 in the third set, the chair umpire incorrectly overruled a line call on break point that would have leveled the match. Henin ended up winning the game and the match. Clijsters said afterwards, \"I\\'m just as disappointed as after the last two grand slam [finals], but I played a lot better this time\". [70] In February, she won her next two tournaments, including the Diamond Games in Antwerp for her first WTA title in her home country. [71] After Clijsters withdrew from the Indian Wells Open following one match with a torn left wrist tendon, she only played in two more WTA events the remainder of the season. She returned to the WTA Tour six weeks later with a wrist brace, but again withdrew after one match. In June, she found out she would need surgery to remove a cyst in her wrist. [72] [73] As a result, she remained out until the Hasselt Cup in Belgium where she needed to retire in her third match. [72] [74]  There were few expectations on Clijsters entering 2005, as it still was not certain whether she would be able to play. [75] After missing the Australian Open, she returned to the tour in February. In her second and third tournaments back, Clijsters won both Tier I events in March, the Indian Wells Open and the Miami Open , to become the second woman to complete the Sunshine Double after Steffi Graf in 1994 and 1996. [76] [77] She defeated world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the final of Indian Wells, as well as No. 2 Amélie Mauresmo and No. 3 Maria Sharapova in her last two matches in Miami. [78] These titles lifted her ranking from outside the top 100 back into the top 20. [18] [75] Clijsters was unable to continue her success into the clay or grass court seasons, winning just one title and losing in the fourth round in three sets to Davenport at both the French Open and Wimbledon . [17] [79]    \"It\\'s very hard to believe and an amazing feeling to have. After being out for so much of last year it\\'s a little bit more special.\"  — Clijsters on winning the 2005 US Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. [80]    After Wimbledon in late June, [81] Clijsters only lost one more match through early October. [17] During this stretch, she won five titles including her third Stanford Classic [82] and her fifth Luxembourg Open . [83] She also built up a 22-match win streak [83] and defeated Henin in the final of the Tier I Canadian Open in their only meeting of the year. [41] [84] Clijsters\\'s most important title of the season was the US Open , her first Grand Slam singles title. As the fourth seed, she was not tested until the quarterfinals, when Venus Williams was two games away from defeating her at a set and a break up. Clijsters rebounded to win the match in three sets and then defeated the top seed and world No. 2 Sharapova in the semifinals, also in three sets. Despite her previous struggles in Grand Slam singles finals, she won the championship against No. 13 Mary Pierce with ease, only conceding four games. [79] As the winner of the US Open Series , Clijsters received double the standard amount of prize money. Her $2.2 million prize was the largest in women\\'s sports history at the time. [85] Clijsters\\'s last tournament of the year was the WTA Tour Championships . Although she had a chance to return to No. 1 if she outperformed the top-ranked Davenport, she only won one match and did not advance out of her round robin group. [86] She finished the year ranked No. 2, having won a tour-best nine titles and all of her finals. [17] [18] [86] She was named both the WTA Player of the Year and the WTA Comeback Player of the Year . [87] Despite this success, Clijsters announced in August that she was planning to retire in 2007 because of her injury troubles. [88]   2006–07: Return to No. 1, hastened retirement [ edit ]   Clijsters in 2006  The 2006 season saw a variety of injury issues for Clijsters. She only played in 14 tournaments, missing the US Open as well as the Fed Cup final. While she reached the semifinals at the other three Grand Slam singles events, she was unable to advance to another final. [17] Clijsters withdrew from her first tournament of the year, the Sydney International with hip and back problems. [89] Although she recovered from those issues in time to reach the semifinals at the Australian Open , she needed to retire from that match as well after twisting her ankle while down a break in the third set against Amélie Mauresmo. [90] Nonetheless, with Davenport losing in the quarterfinals, Clijsters regained the No. 1 ranking. [91] She held the top ranking through mid-March. [18] Clijsters returned for the Diamond Games where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo, [92] but needed to withdraw from the Indian Wells Open because of the same ankle injury. [93] While she was healthy enough to play a regular schedule during the clay and grass court seasons, Henin continued her recent dominance of their rivalry over this stretch. She defeated Clijsters in the semifinals of three consecutive events, including the French Open and Wimbledon . [17] [94] [95]  During the US Open Series, Clijsters won her fourth Stanford Classic [96] and finished runner-up to Maria Sharapova at the Tier I San Diego Classic . [97] However, her summer season came to an end when she fell on her left wrist in her opening round match at the Canadian Open . [98] This injury kept her out until late October. She made her return at the Hasselt Cup and won her second consecutive title at the event. [99] Clijsters entered the WTA Tour Championships ranked No. 5 in the world, [18] where all three other players she was grouped with were Russian. [100] Although she lost to her group\\'s top seed, Sharapova, she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Dementieva to advance. Her season ended in the semifinals, where she lost to world No. 1 Mauresmo. [101]  Clijsters entered 2007 intending to retire at the end of the season, [102] but only ended up playing in five tournaments due to injuries. [103] She won her only title of the year in her first tournament, the Sydney International . The Australian Open was her only Grand Slam event of the season. For the second consecutive season, she lost in the semifinals, this time to top seed Sharapova. Clijsters\\'s last tournament in Belgium was the Diamond Games , where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo for the second year in a row. [103] A hip injury limited Clijsters\\'s remaining schedule. [104] In her last two tournaments, she lost to Li Na in the fourth round of the Miami Open in March [105] and qualifier Julia Vakulenko in her opening match at the Warsaw Open in May. [106] Her last win was against Samantha Stosur in Miami. [17] A few days after losing in Warsaw, Clijsters announced her retirement at the age of 23, forgoing plans to finish the season. [107]   Two-year hiatus [ edit ]  A few months after Clijsters retired, she married basketball player Brian Lynch . She gave birth to a daughter in early 2008, less than two months after her father Leo Clijsters was diagnosed with lung cancer. He died twelve months later in January 2009. Clijsters said, \"The birth of Jada was the best moment of my life, but it also taught me a lesson because we knew that my Dad was terminally ill. I realised that new life had been born, but a few months later another life would disappear. It was a very intense period in our lives.\" [108]  Nearly two months after her father\\'s death, it was announced that Clijsters would play in an exhibition in May with Tim Henman against Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi to test the new retractable roof on Centre Court at Wimbledon. [109] In March, Clijsters stated that she was planning to come out of retirement, motivated by returning to the \"training schedule from [her] pro days\" to prepare for the Wimbledon exhibition. She added that she was taking a different approach to tennis, saying, \"I am looking at this as a second career, not as a comeback as I am now in a situation where not everything revolves around tennis 24 hours a day.\" [110] Clijsters and Henman won the exhibition doubles, and Clijsters also defeated her idol Graf in singles. She commented, \"I wanted to feel good here on court. And I\\'ve enjoyed it. This is the pleasure which was lacking at the end of my first career. But now I\\'ve got my motivation back.\" [111]   2009–10: Start of second career, back-to-back US Open titles [ edit ]   Clijsters at the 2010 US Open  With no ranking, Clijsters needed wild cards to begin her comeback. She requested and received wild cards for the Cincinnati Open , the Canadian Open , and the US Open . [110] [112] In her return to the tour in Cincinnati, Clijsters defeated three top 20 opponents, including No. 6 Svetlana Kuznetsova, [113] before losing to world No. 1 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals. [78] [114] She recorded another top ten victory in Canada over No. 9 Victoria Azarenka . [78] Clijsters was still unranked entering the US Open, as players needed three tour events to have a ranking at the time. [115] Nonetheless, she made it to the final, notably upsetting both Williams sisters, No. 3 Venus in the fourth round and No. 2 Serena in the semifinals. She defeated Venus in a tight third set after they split the first two 6–0. [116] Her straight sets win over Serena was overshadowed by her opponent receiving a point penalty on match point for verbally abusing a line judge. [117] Clijsters then defeated No. 8 Caroline Wozniacki to win her second US Open championship. She became the first unseeded woman to win the title at the event, and the first mother to win a Grand Slam singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. [118] [119] [120] With the title, she entered the WTA rankings at No. 19. [115] Her only other tournament of the year was the Luxembourg Open , where she lost her second match. [121] At the end of the season, she won the WTA Comeback Player of the Year award for the second time. [87]  Clijsters planned a limited schedule for 2010 to keep her focus on her family and ended up playing just eleven tournaments. [122] In her first event of the year, she won the Brisbane International , narrowly defeating Henin in a third set tiebreak in Henin\\'s first tournament back from her own retirement. [123] She entered the Australian Open as one of the favourites, but was upset by No. 19 Nadia Petrova in the third round, only winning one game in that loss. [124] Clijsters did not return to the tour until March. After an early loss at the Indian Wells Open , she won the Miami Open for the second time. The only set she lost was in the semifinals to Henin, who she again defeated in a third set tiebreak. [78] [125] She only conceded three games in the final against Venus Williams. [126] During the clay court season, Clijsters tore a muscle in her left foot, which kept her out of the French Open. [127] [128] Although she returned for Wimbledon , she was upset in the quarterfinals by Vera Zvonareva after recording another win over Henin in the previous round. [129] [130]    \"That defeat against Zvonareva at Wimbledon was hard to take. It had been perhaps my best and last chance to reach the final. In the semifinal of the US Open, I was absolutely bent on gaining revenge. And I succeeded, too... I\\'d become the player I\\'d always wanted to be.\"  — Clijsters on the 2010 US Open final. [131]    In the latter half of the year, Clijsters entered only four tournaments. During the US Open Series, she won the Cincinnati Open , the tournament where she returned from retirement a year earlier. [132] At her next event, she was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open by Zvonareva while struggling with a thigh injury. [133] Nonetheless, Clijsters recovered to defend her title at the US Open . In the last three rounds, she defeated three top ten players in No. 6 Samantha Stosur, No. 4 Venus Williams, and No. 8 Vera Zvonareva. [78] Venus came the closest to ending her title defense, but lost in three sets after serving two double faults in the second set tiebreak which could have won her the match. [134] Clijsters won the final over Zvonareva with ease in less than an hour. This was her third consecutive title at the US Open and the fourth consecutive time she made it to the championship match, having skipped the tournament four times since 2003. [131] Clijsters\\' final event of the season was the WTA Tour Championships , where she qualified for the seventh time. Despite a loss to Zvonareva in her last round robin match, she advanced to the knockout rounds and defeated No. 5 Stosur and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki for her third title at the year-end championships. [135] Clijsters finished the season at No. 3 and was named WTA Player of the Year for the second time. [18] [136]   2011–12: Australian Open champion, last reign at No. 1 [ edit ]  By the start of 2011, Clijsters knew she was planning to retire in 2012 as she did not want to be on the tour while her daughter was in school. [137] She began the season at the Sydney International , where she finished runner-up to Li Na in straight sets despite winning the first five games of the match. [138] The two also met in the final of their next tournament, the Australian Open . Although Clijsters again lost the first set, she recovered to win the championship, her fourth Grand Slam singles title and first outside of the US Open. [137] [139] This title would be the last of Clijsters\\'s career. [17] She made one last final at her next WTA event, the Paris Open , where she was defeated by Petra Kvitová . Nonetheless, this result helped Clijsters regain the world No. 1 ranking before Caroline Wozniacki took it back one week later. [140] [141] During the rest of the season, Clijsters was limited by a variety of injuries and only played five more tournaments. [78] She needed to retire from a fourth round match at the Indian Wells Open due to a shoulder injury. [142] Then, as a result of a right ankle injury suffered while dancing at a wedding in April, the French Open was the only clay court event she entered. At the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, she was upset in the second round by No. 114 Arantxa Rus after failing to convert two match points in the second set. [143] Aggravating that ankle injury at her next event then forced her to miss Wimbledon. [144] Clijsters returned for the Canadian Open , where she suffered an abdominal injury that kept her out the remainder of the season. [142] [145]    Clijsters after her last WTA singles match win against Victoria Duval  Clijsters was unable to stay healthy in her last year on the WTA Tour. In the first week of the season, she returned to the tour for the Brisbane International . After winning her first three matches back, she needed to retire in the semifinals due to hip spasms, a precautionary measure to prepare for the Australian Open. [146] As the defending champion at the year\\'s first Grand Slam event, Clijsters made it to the semifinals. Her fourth round victory came against No. 5 Li Na in a rematch of the 2011 final. She overcame rolling her ankle in the first set and saved four match points at 6–2 in the second set tiebreak to win in three sets. [147] After Clijsters defeated world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals, [148] she lost to No. 3 Victoria Azarenka in another three set match. [149] [150] Both her hip and ankle continued to trouble her for months after the tournament, forcing her to skip the clay court season. [151] [152] After playing once in March and returning in mid-June, [151] [153] the last WTA events of Clijsters\\'s career were the final two Grand Slam tournaments of the season. [78] She lost at Wimbledon in the fourth round to No. 8 Angelique Kerber , only winning two games. [154] Clijsters entered the US Open having not lost a match there since the 2003 final. She recorded her last WTA singles match win against Victoria Duval in the first round before falling to Laura Robson in her next match. [155] Her career ended with a second round mixed doubles loss alongside Bob Bryan to the eventual champions Ekaterina Makarova and Bruno Soares , at which point she officially retired. [155] [156]   National representation [ edit ]  Fed Cup [ edit ]  Clijsters made her Fed Cup debut for Belgium in 2000 at the age of 16. The top-tier World Group that year consisted of 13 teams, 12 of which were divided into three round robin groups. The winners of the round robin groups in April would compete with the defending champion United States team in a knockout format for the title in November. Belgium was placed in a group with Australia , France , and Russia . Each tie was contested over one day as a best-of-three rubbers, two in singles and the last in doubles. Clijsters only played singles, while Els Callens and Laurence Courtois played all three doubles matches. Although Clijsters narrowly lost her debut to Jelena Dokic of Australia by a score of 9–7 in the third set, her teammates were able to secure the tie. She won her other two matches against Nathalie Tauziat of France and Anna Kournikova of Russia, both of which were crucial as Belgium won each of those ties 2–1 as well to win the group. In the semifinals, Henin returned to the team as they faced the United States, the hosts for the final rounds. After Henin lost to Monica Seles , Clijsters needed to defeat Lindsay Davenport to keep Belgium in the tournament. She won the second set, but ultimately lost the match. [157]  The following year, the format for the Fed Cup changed again. The entire competition was played out in November. The three round robin pools were reduced to two and the winners of each pool would contest a final tie for the title. Belgium\\'s team of Clijsters, Henin, Callens, and Courtois from the 2000 final all returned for 2001 . The United States withdrew before the start of the event, citing security concerns a few months after the September 11 terrorist attacks . With Henin and Clijsters exclusively playing singles, and Callens and Courtois playing doubles, Belgium won all nine of their rubbers against Spain , Germany , and Australia to advance to the final. Facing Russia, Henin defeated Nadia Petrova and Clijsters defeated Elena Dementieva to secure Belgium\\'s first Fed Cup crown. Courtois commented, \"We were never under any pressure, mainly because Kim and Justine were so strong.\" [158]  While Clijsters and Henin were on the team, Belgium came closest to another Fed Cup triumph in 2006. In this year, the World Group consisted of eight teams in a knockout tournament. The three rounds were spread out over April, July, and September. Each tie was played as a best-of-five rubbers, with four singles followed by one doubles. In the first round against Russia, both Clijsters and Henin made themselves available and won three out of four singles matches to advance. [159] Although Henin missed the semifinal, Clijsters and Kirsten Flipkens were able to lead Belgium to a victory over the United States, who were also short-handed without Lindsay Davenport or the Williams sisters. [160] However, Clijsters was forced to miss the Fed Cup final due to a wrist injury. [98] Henin and Flipkens returned for the final, which Belgium hosted against Italy . The tie was decided by the doubles rubber, which Belgium lost after Henin aggravated a knee injury she suffered in one of her singles rubbers and needed to retire down 2–0 in the third set. [161]  Clijsters also played on the Belgium Fed Cup team from 2002–05, and 2010–11 after she returned from retirement. The team\\'s best results in those years were two semifinal appearances in 2003 and 2011 . Clijsters missed the ties in which Belgium was eliminated in both instances. [162] [163] Overall, Clijsters compiled a 24–4 record in Fed Cup, split across 21–3 in singles and 3–1 in doubles. [164]   Hopman Cup [ edit ]  Clijsters participated in the Hopman Cup from 2001–04, partnering with Olivier Rochus in the first instance and Xavier Malisse thereafter. The tournament consists of eight teams, each with one female and one male player from the same country. The teams are divided into two round robin groups, the winners of which compete for the title. Each tie consists of a women\\'s singles match, a men\\'s singles match, and a mixed doubles match. The Belgian team did not advance to final in any of the years Clijsters participated. Their best performances came in 2002 and 2003 when they won two out of three round robin ties. [165] [166] [167] [168]  In 2002, they finished tied for first with the United States and Italy in a group that also featured France. Belgium\\'s only loss came against the United States, with Clijsters and Malisse losing both singles matches to Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill respectively. Although the United States lost to Italy, they advanced out of the group on the tiebreak criteria, having won six rubbers compared to the five won by each of Belgium and Italy. Both of the ties Belgium had won were by a score of 2–1, with Clijsters losing to Francesca Schiavone against Italy and the pair losing the mixed doubles against the French team of Virginie Razzano and Arnaud Clément . [166] The following year, Clijsters and Malisse again lost to the United States, who fielded a different team of Serena Williams and James Blake . [167]   Olympics [ edit ]  Clijsters did not compete at the Olympics until 2012 near the end of her career. She had been ranked inside the top 40 in the months leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics in September, high enough to qualify. However, she did not make herself available for selection for a variety of reasons including issues with her shoulder and the event\\'s timing a week after the US Open. [169] During the 2004 Athens Olympics , she was in the middle of a long absence from competition after undergoing wrist surgery. [72] However, she had announced before the year began that she did not intend to compete at the Games because Adidas was the Belgian team\\'s uniform sponsor and her contract with Fila forbade her from wearing clothing from another company. [170] The 2008 Beijing Olympics took place during her first retirement. [150]  Having missed these three previous events, Clijsters\\'s desire to represent Belgium at the Olympics was one of the underlying reasons why she prolonged her second career until the 2012 London Games in late July. [150] At the time, she did not have good results at her most recent tournaments, withdrawing from the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships in the semifinals in June due to injury and suffering a lopsided loss in the fourth round at Wimbledon. In her Olympic debut, Clijsters won her first three matches in straight sets, defeating Roberta Vinci , Carla Suárez Navarro , and No. 12 Ana Ivanovic in succession. [78] She faced No. 3 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets one match before the medal rounds. [150] [171]   Rivalries [ edit ]  Clijsters vs. Henin [ edit ]  Main article: Clijsters–Henin rivalry  Clijsters\\'s biggest rival was Justine Henin, who grew up in the French-speaking part of Belgium. They have been regarded as having little in common except their nationality and their relationship has varied over time. [172] Their rivalry began during their junior years when they were both considered promising young talents. [6] They started out as friends and won the Belgian Junior Championships as doubles partners at ages ten and eleven respectively, despite only being able to communicate with hand signals due to Clijsters not knowing French and Henin not knowing Flemish. [5] [6] [159] However, their friendship began to fade by their mid-teens, leading to disputes that their coaches would try to keep out of the media. [173] Clijsters attributed this deterioration in part to one of Henin\\'s coaches telling Henin, \"she had to hate all of her opponents, and only then could she win.\" She also acknowledged they had very different personalities. [174]  Clijsters and Henin typically downplayed any disagreements between them, saying they were overdramatized by the media. [5] [172] When they were professionals, Clijsters accused Henin of routinely faking injuries in their matches to receive medical timeouts. Additionally, Clijsters\\'s father seemed to allege that Henin was taking performance-enhancing drugs . [5] [172] Although they had won the Fed Cup together in 2001, they were not interested in playing on the same team in 2004 or 2005. The following year, Clijsters\\'s former coach Carl Maes, who was then the Belgium Fed Cup captain, helped convince Clijsters to reunite with Henin, and together they ultimately reached another final. [159]  On the court, they played each other in 25 WTA matches, making each of them the other\\'s most frequent opponent. Although Clijsters won the series 13–12, Henin won seven out of their eleven meetings in finals including all three at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest stage win Clijsters had at a major was in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open. She also defeated Henin en route to her first WTA Tour Championship in 2002. Clijsters dominated their hard court meetings 8–4, while Henin dominated on clay 5–1. Henin also won three of their five grass court encounters. Before both of their first retirements, Henin was leading the series 12–10. However, Clijsters won all three of their meetings during their comebacks to win the series. [41]   Clijsters vs. Williams sisters [ edit ]  The Williams sisters are widely recognized as dominating tennis since around the turn of the century. [175] They were both No. 1 in the world and combined for 15 Grand Slam singles titles while Clijsters was on tour. [176] [177] Clijsters had a record of just 2–7 against Serena, who she called her toughest opponent. [7] [178] She fared better against Venus, compiling a winning record of 7–6. [179]  Clijsters\\'s rivalry with Serena included two of the biggest controversies in Serena\\'s career: the 2001 Indian Wells final which led to both Williams sisters\\' long boycott of the tournament, and the 2009 US Open semifinal which Serena lost on a point penalty. [30] [117] Serena defeated Clijsters in their first five meetings. She also won all four of their three-set encounters, including their 1999 US Open third round match and their 2003 Australian Open semifinal where Clijsters had the opportunity to serve for both matches. [21] [43] [178] Although Clijsters only had two wins against Serena, both were considered big upsets and among the most important wins of her career. Her victory in the 2002 WTA Tour Championship final gave Clijsters her biggest title at the time, and her win at the 2009 US Open set up her first Grand Slam singles title as a mother one match later. [23] [180] Clijsters also defeated Venus in both of those tournaments, making her the only player to record wins over both Williams sisters at the same event twice. [181]  Venus also initially dominated her rivalry with Clijsters. She won six of their first eight meetings, including two in the late stages of Grand Slam tournaments in the quarterfinals of the 2001 US Open and the semifinals of 2003 Wimbledon. Venus also eliminated Clijsters from the Diamond Games in Belgium twice in 2003 and 2005. Additionally, one of Clijsters\\'s first two wins against Venus was a retirement due to injury at the 2002 WTA Tour Championships. Nonetheless, Clijsters rebounded to win their last five meetings and end her career leading in their head-to-head record. Three of those five victories came at the US Open en route to her three titles at the event in 2005, 2009, and 2010. [179]   Other rivals [ edit ]  In addition to Henin and the Williams sisters, Clijsters also developed rivalries with several other players who had been ranked No. 1 in the world. Two of her most frequent opponents were Lindsay Davenport and Amélie Mauresmo. Clijsters narrowly had winning records against both of them, going 9–8 versus Davenport and 8–7 versus Mauresmo. Davenport had won six of their first seven meetings before Clijsters won eight of their next nine encounters, including all five in 2003. Clijsters defeated Davenport in all four of their meetings in finals, including two at the Indian Wells Open. While Davenport had a 5–1 lead in Grand Slam tournaments, Clijsters won their latest-stage such meeting in the semifinals of the 2003 US Open. [182] Unlike against Davenport, Clijsters initially dominated her rivalry with Mauresmo, winning eight of their first ten matches before Mauresmo took the last five. They met in two WTA Tour Championship finals, which they split. Mauresmo also denied Clijsters chances to win more titles in her home country when she won their finals at both the 2006 and 2007 Diamond Games. [183]   Exhibition matches [ edit ]   King Baudouin Stadium , the site of the record-setting match between Clijsters and Serena Williams  During Clijsters\\'s first retirement, the invitation to participate in the roof test exhibition series at Wimbledon in May 2009 inspired her to return to the WTA Tour. [108] In the summer, she joined the St. Louis Aces of the World Team Tennis league to help prepare for her comeback. [184] She also participated in World Team Tennis the following year as a member of the New York Sportimes . [185] Ten years after the roof test on Centre Court that inspired her comeback, Clijsters returned to Wimbledon to participate in an exhibition series to test the new roof on Court No. 1 in which she played a set of singles against Venus Williams as well as a set of mixed doubles. [186]  On 8 July 2010, an exhibition match between Clijsters and Henin was scheduled as an attempt to set a new world record for largest attendance at a tennis match. The contest took place at the King Baudouin Stadium and was a part of the Best of Belgium national festival. After Henin needed to withdraw from the match due to an elbow injury, Serena Williams was chosen as a replacement. Although Williams injured her foot several days before the match, she chose to play. Clijsters defeated Williams in straight sets. A total of 35,681 people attended the match, breaking the world record of 30,472 set in 1973 by the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs . [187]  Beginning in 2009, the Diamond Games in Antwerp was reorganized from a WTA tournament into an exhibition series. During her comeback, Clijsters played at the event three times, winning matches against Venus Williams in 2009, [188] Henin in 2010, [189] and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in 2011. [190] She continued to play at the event after retiring. The 2012 edition was named \"Kim\\'s Thank You Games\" in honor of her retirement, and the following year the event was known as the Kim Clijsters Invitational. [191] [192] In 2015 , the Diamond Games were revived as a WTA event with Clijsters serving as the tournament director. She also played an exhibition set with finalist Andrea Petkovic after her opponent withdrew before the start of the championship match due to injury. [193]  Since her retirement in 2012, Clijsters has regularly played in the legends, champions, and invitation doubles events at all four Grand Slam tournaments. [194] [195] [196] One of her matches in the 2017 Wimbledon ladies\\' invitation doubles event drew public interest for Clijsters inviting a male spectator onto the court to play a few points. The spectator, Chris Quinn, had suggested Clijsters try a body serve when she had asked the crowd whether she should serve left or right. Before playing the points, she gave Quinn a women\\'s shirt and skort so that he could abide by Wimbledon\\'s all-white dress code. A video of the incident has over four million views on YouTube. [197] [198]   Legacy [ edit ]  Clijsters has been ranked as the 14th greatest women\\'s tennis player in the Open Era by Tennis.com . [199] Her 41 singles titles are the 14th-most in the Open Era. [200] Since 2000, only the Williams sisters, Justine Henin, and Maria Sharapova have won more than her four Grand Slam singles titles. [201] The three titles she won at the WTA Tour Championships are tied for the fifth-most in history behind only Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, and Chris Evert. [202] Clijsters was a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the French Open and Wimbledon in doubles and the US Open and Australian Open in singles. [24] Her prowess at singles and doubles is also highlighted by her becoming one of six players in WTA history to be No. 1 in the world in both rankings at the same time. [53]  Clijsters and Henin are recognized for \"putting Belgium on the tennis map\". [199] Before they established themselves in the upper echelon of women\\'s tennis, Dominique Van Roost was the only player in Belgian history to be ranked in the top ten of the ATP or WTA rankings, a mark she did not achieve until 1998 after Clijsters and Henin turned professional. [203] The Belgium Fed Cup team had never reached the quarterfinals until 1997 when they made the semifinals. With Clijsters on the team, Belgium made it to at least the semifinals four times, reaching the final in 2006 and winning the championship in 2001. [204] She also became the first Belgian to be ranked No. 1 in each of singles and doubles. [39] Belgium was regarded as dominating women\\'s tennis when Clijsters and Henin were the top two players in the world for several months in late 2003. [172] After Clijsters\\'s retirement, she established the Kim Clijsters Academy in her hometown of Bree. The academy is run by Clijsters\\'s longtime coach Carl Maes and is intended to serve young players. [205] Compatriot Elise Mertens is among those who train at the facility. [206]  Clijsters was one of the most popular and well-liked players in tennis among both fans and her fellow players. [180] [199] She won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award a record eight times. Clijsters was proud of her reputation as one of the nicest players on the WTA Tour, saying, \"I always try every day to be a good person and to be nice to others, and I think that’s probably the most important thing. I’m proud that I won tournaments and everything, but I want players to think that Kim was a nice person.\" [207] Clijsters was also regarded as a source of inspiration to mothers on the WTA Tour, a role she embraced. [208] She is one of three mothers to win a Grand Slam singles title, and her three such titles are tied with Margaret Court for the most of all-time. Additionally, Clijsters is the only mother to be ranked No. 1 in the world since the start of the WTA rankings in 1975. [209] She appeared on the Time 100 list in 2011 as one of the most influential people in the world in large part because of her successful comeback. [210]   Playing style [ edit ]   Clijsters serving  Clijsters was an all-court player who employed a mixture of offensive and defensive styles of play. [24] On the defensive side, her movement was regarded as exceptional, enabling her to endure long rallies. [24] [211] Maria Sharapova has commented that, \"You just have to expect that she\\'s going to get every ball back.\" [212] In addition to her movement, Clijsters often extended points with her signature shot, a stretched-out wide forehand , also known as a squash shot. This type of forehand involves hitting the ball with slice to make up for being out of position. [213] When hitting a squash shot on the run, Clijsters was known for her trademark play of sliding towards the ball and finishing in a split to extend her reach. [214] While most players can only slide on clay, Clijsters could slide on any surface. Tennis journalist Peter Bodo has noted, \"Grass and hard courts do not \\'permit\\' sliding unless your name is Kim Clijsters.\" [215]    Clijsters hitting a backhand  The strengths of Clijsters\\'s game were built around playing aggressively to generate offense without losing control. [216] She excelled at hitting both forehand and backhand winners from the baseline. [217] Clijsters was regarded as one of the best returners of serve and would try to \"take control of the point immediately... to [put herself] in an offensive position from the beginning\". [218] She was aggressive in the middle of points as well. While the squash shot is generally regarded as a defensive shot, Clijsters could turn it into an offensive weapon by placing it well enough to have time to recover into a good court position. [213] Additionally, she possessed the ability to quickly move in from the baseline to the net, setting herself up to hit winners and finish points. She was adept at hitting swinging volleys on both the forehand and backhand sides because of her solid groundstroke technique. [219] Clijsters credited her experience in doubles for improving her net game in singles, saying \"it made [her] focus on going to the net more\" and helped her \"know when to come to the net\". [220] Her coach Wim Fissette attributed her success at Grand Slam events after her comeback to being more aggressive than she was before her first retirement. [221]   Coaches [ edit ]  Clijsters worked with Belgian coaches throughout her career. Her first coach was Bart Van Kerckhoven, who she later invited to her championship match at the 2010 US Open. [187] She began her professional career with Carl Maes as her coach. Maes was a student of Benny Vanhoudt who led the Saturday training sessions while Clijsters was also working with Vanhoudt in Diest. [8] He moved to the Flemish Tennis Association Centre in Wilrijk when Clijsters was 13 years old and invited her to join him. In her first year in Wilrijk, she also worked with Marc De Hous. [9] Maes coached Clijsters from 1996 to May 2002, during which she won the Fed Cup and finished as the runner-up at the 2001 French Open. [173]  Shortly before the 2002 US Open , she hired De Hous as her new coach and continued to work with him through 2005. Under De Hous, Clijsters won two WTA Tour Championships and two Grand Slam doubles titles. They split a week after she won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 2005 US Open. It was reported that De Hous left because he was unhappy with only receiving a $7,500 bonus from her $2.2 million in US Open prize money; however, he denied this was his only financial compensation and attributed his departure to wanting to \"take on new challenges\" after all of their success in 2005. [79] [222] [223] Clijsters opted to play without a coach from then until her first retirement. [224]  When Clijsters began her comeback in 2009, she hired Wim Fissette to be her coach. Fissette, who is three years older, had trained with Clijsters under Vanhoudt when they were both juniors. [8] He had also served as her hitting partner from 2005 until her first retirement. [225] With Fissette as her coach, Clijsters won three more Grand Slam singles titles and regained the world No. 1 ranking. In June 2011, she rehired Maes as her coach, leading to Fissette\\'s departure several months later. [226] [227] Clijsters worked with Maes through the end of her career. [155]   Endorsements [ edit ]  During her playing career, Clijsters was represented by Belgian company Golazo Sports. [228] [229]  Babolat has sponsored her racquets since 1999, and she specifically has used the Pure Drive model. [230] Fila has been Clijsters\\'s clothing sponsor since 2002. She had previously worn Nike apparel, but was not under contract. [231] [232]  Clijsters is conscious about selecting which products to endorse, saying, \"If it\\'s not healthy for kids, for example, I\\'m not going to endorse a product. I don\\'t want to give the wrong impression. We try to live a healthy lifestyle and if it doesn\\'t match me as a person, I turn it down. To have my name on a product, I want to be behind it fully.\" [233] She has turned down Nutella in addition to endorsements that involved her daughter. [234] [235] While on tour, she endorsed banana supplier Chiquita and United Soft Drinks , the producer of the AA sports drink. [235] Additionally, she was a brand ambassador for nutrition company USANA as well as the Citizen Watch Signature Collection. [236] [237] She also had endorsement deals with Belgian telecommunications company Telenet , personnel services firm Adecco , and the travel services company Thomas Cook Group . [235]  Since Clijsters\\'s retirement, Van Lanschot banking helps sponsor the Kim Clijsters Academy. [238]   Personal life [ edit ]  Clijsters is married to Brian Lynch , an American basketball coach and former player. Lynch played college basketball at Villanova before pursuing a professional career in Europe. The two met while Lynch was a member of Euphony Bree , the team based in Clijsters\\'s hometown, and initially bonded over both having pet bulldogs. They became a couple in 2005 and married in 2007. [108] They have three children: a daughter Jada (born 2008), and two sons Jack  (born 2013) and Blake (born 2016). The family splits their time living in Bree and New Jersey . [239]  Clijsters\\'s sister Elke , who is younger by a year and a half, was also a promising tennis player. Like Kim, Elke won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles. [240] She was also the ITF World Junior Doubles Champion in 2002. [241] On the professional tour, she achieved a top 400 ranking in singles and a top 250 ranking in doubles. [242] Kim and Elke entered one doubles tournament together on the WTA Tour at the 2004 Diamond Games in Antwerp. They won their opening match against Selima Sfar and Caroline Vis before losing to the second-seeded team of Emilie Loit and Petra Mandula in the next round. [17] Elke retired in 2004 at age 19 due to persistent back problems. [243]  In Clijsters\\'s early career, she was in a long-term relationship with Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. They met at the 2000 Australian Open and were engaged before mutually ending their relationship in late 2004. [244] The pair entered the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon in 2000, losing in the final. [23] Their relationship earned Clijsters the nickname \"Aussie Kim\" and made her popular among Australian tennis fans even after they separated. When Clijsters won the 2011 Australian Open, she believed she earned her nickname, saying, \"Now you can finally call me Aussie Kim\". [137]  Clijsters\\'s childhood tennis idol was Steffi Graf. [2] She cites her lone WTA Tour match against Graf at Wimbledon in 1999 as being very influential, saying, \"It was unbelievable. All I wanted to do was watch her. I wanted to see how she tied her shoelaces, what her ponytail looked like, how she carried her bag. Even though I lost, the impact of that and the motivation it gave me was huge. It was definitely the biggest moment of my career\". [239] She also looked up to Monica Seles and viewed both Graf and Seles as role models, drawing inspiration from their level of focus. [2] [220]  Clijsters is involved with multiple organizations that help children. She has served as an ambassador for SOS Children\\'s Villages in Belgium since 2010. SOS provides aid to children living without their parents and to impoverished families. [245] [246] Clijsters has also founded Ten4Kim, a nonprofit that funds junior tennis players who cannot afford the costs associated with training at a high level. [247] [248]  Since Clijsters retired, she has served as a part-time coach to several players, including compatriots Elise Mertens and Yanina Wickmayer . She has also occasionally been a commentator at the Grand Slam tournaments, working for the BBC and Fox Sports Australia at Wimbledon and for Channel 7 at the Australian Open.
